## Best Practices

### Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lazy Loading">
    Use lazy loading for pages with multiple embeds:
    ```html
    <iframe loading="lazy" ...></iframe>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Responsive Design">
    Wrap in a container for responsive sizing:
    ```html
    <div style="max-width: 600px;">
      <iframe width="100%" ...></iframe>
    </div>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limit Embeds Per Page">
    Too many embeds slow page load. Limit to 3-5 per page.
