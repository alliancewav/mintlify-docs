## Overview

Collections are curated groups of tracks that help organize and showcase content on BeatPass. They differ from playlists in that they're designed for discovery and curation rather than personal listening queues.

## Best Practices

### For Creators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Choose names that clearly communicate the collection's theme or purpose.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write Good Descriptions">
    Help users understand what they'll find—genre, mood, use case.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Curate Thoughtfully">
    Quality over quantity. A focused 20-track collection often outperforms a random 100-track dump.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update Regularly">
    Keep collections fresh by adding new releases and removing outdated tracks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Listeners
