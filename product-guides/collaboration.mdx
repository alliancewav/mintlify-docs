## Revenue Splits

<Warning>
  Revenue split functionality is managed manually. BeatPass does not automatically split payments between collaborators.
</Warning>

### Current Process

1. Primary uploader receives all platform earnings
2. Collaborators arrange splits privately
3. Document agreements outside the platform
4. Honor commitments to maintain trust

### Best Practices

- Discuss splits before uploading
- Put agreements in writing
- Be transparent about earnings
- Pay collaborators promptly

## Finding Collaborators

### Through Beat Requests

Many collaborations start from beat request interactions:

1. Artist posts a request
2. Multiple producers respond
3. Producers connect with each other
4. Future collaborations emerge

### Through the Platform

- Browse producer profiles
- Follow creators whose style complements yours
- Engage through messaging
- Propose collaboration opportunities

## Reposts

Reposts let you share tracks to your profile, helping collaborators and favorite producers gain visibility.

### How Reposts Work

When you repost a track:

1. It appears on your profile in a "Reposts" section
2. Your followers see it in their feed
3. The original creator is notified
4. You can undo at any time

### Reposting a Track

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Track">
    Navigate to any track page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Repost">
    Click the repost icon (🔄) below the track.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Track is immediately shared to your profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Undoing a Repost

To remove a repost:

1. Go to the track page (or your profile > Reposts)
2. Click the repost icon again
3. The repost is removed instantly

### Where Reposts Appear

| Location | Visibility |
|----------|------------|
| Your profile | "Reposts" tab |
| Followers' feeds | Activity feed |
| Track page | Shows repost count |

### Repost Limits

To prevent spam:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Reposts per hour | 20 |
| Reposts per day | 100 |

<Note>
  Reposts don't affect the original track's ownership or analytics—they're purely for sharing and discovery.
</Note>
