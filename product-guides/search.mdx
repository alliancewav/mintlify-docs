## Overview

BeatPass provides powerful search and discovery tools to help artists find the perfect beat. This guide explains how search works, what fields are indexed, and how to use filters effectively.

## How Search Works

### Indexed Fields

When you search, BeatPass looks across these fields:

| Field | Indexed | Weight |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Track title** | Yes | High |
| **Artist/producer name** | Yes | High |
| **Tags** | Yes | High |
| **Genre** | Yes | Medium |
| **Description** | Yes | Medium |
| **Lyrics** | Yes | Low |
| **Album name** | Yes | Medium |

<Note>
  Search is case-insensitive. "Dark Trap" and "dark trap" return the same results.
</Note>

### Search Behavior

| Feature | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Multi-word queries** | Matches tracks containing all words |
| **Partial matches** | Supported (e.g., "trap" matches "trapped") |
| **Exact phrases** | Use quotes: `"dark melodic"` |
| **Typo tolerance** | Limited; spell correctly for best results |

---

## Default Sort Order

When no sort is specified, results are ordered by **relevance**:

| Factor | Impact on Ranking |
|--------|-------------------|
| Query match quality | High |
| Field matched (title vs description) | High |
| Track popularity (plays, saves) | Medium |
| Recency | Low |

### Available Sort Options

| Sort | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Relevance** | Best match to your query (default) |
| **Newest** | Most recently uploaded |
| **Popular** | Highest play counts |
| **Trending** | Rising engagement velocity |

---

## Search Filters

### Genre Filter

Filter by musical genre:

| Category | Examples |

## Using Filters Effectively

### Combining Filters

Filters are **additive** (AND logic):

```
Genre: Trap + BPM: 140-150 + Key: Minor
→ Returns trap beats at 140-150 BPM in a minor key
```

### Filter Reset

Click **Clear Filters** to reset all filters and start fresh.

## Search Tips

### Finding Specific Styles

| Goal | Search Strategy |
|------|-----------------|
| Drake-style beats | Search "drake type" or filter R&B/Trap + 80-100 BPM |
| Dark trap | Search "dark trap" or use Mood: Dark + Genre: Trap |
| Lo-fi study beats | Search "lo-fi chill" or filter Lo-Fi + 70-90 BPM |
| Festival EDM | Search "festival" or filter Electronic + 128 BPM |

### Using Tags Effectively

Tags are highly weighted in search. Try:

- Mood tags: "dark", "chill", "aggressive"
- Style tags: "melodic", "hard", "bouncy"
- Influence tags: "metro boomin type", "pierre bourne style"
- Use case: "freestyle", "hook", "commercial"

### Exact Phrase Search

For specific phrases, use quotes:

```
"summer vibes"     → Matches exact phrase
summer vibes       → Matches tracks with both words anywhere
```

## Search Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start broad, then narrow">
    Begin with general terms, then add filters to refine. Starting too specific may miss relevant results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use BPM ranges">
    Instead of exact BPM (140), use a range (138-142) to catch tracks with slight variations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine key + mood">
    Searching "minor key" alone is broad. Add mood: "dark minor" or filter by minor keys + Dark mood.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Try artist influence tags">
    Many producers tag their beats with artist influences: "travis scott type", "juice wrld style", etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check spelling">
    Search has limited typo tolerance. "melodick" won't find "melodic".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Power User Tips

| Tip | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Exact phrase matching | `"dark trap"` (with quotes) |
| Combine multiple terms | `melodic guitar emotional` |
| Use specific BPM for matching vocals | Filter to ±2 BPM of your vocal track |
| Search by producer | Enter producer name directly |
| Genre + mood combo | Filter Genre: Trap + Mood: Dark |

### What Doesn't Work

| Query Type | Status | Alternative |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) | Not supported | Use multiple terms |
| Wildcards (trap*) | Not supported | Use full terms |
| Exclusion (-word) | Not supported | Use filters instead |
| Field-specific (title:word) | Not supported | General search only |

---

## Search Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Min query length** | 2 characters |
| **Max query length** | 100 characters |
| **Rate limit** | 60 searches/minute |
| **Results per page** | 20 (paginated) |
| **Max results** | 1,000 per query |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search returns no results">
    - Check spelling
    - Try broader terms
    - Remove some filters
    - Use fewer/different keywords
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't find a specific track">
    - Search by exact title in quotes
    - Search by producer name
    - Check if track was removed
    - It may still be processing (wait 5-10 min for new uploads)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Filters not working">
    - Ensure filters aren't too restrictive
    - Some combinations yield few results
    - Try resetting filters and adding one at a time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Results seem irrelevant">
    - Use more specific search terms
    - Add filters to narrow results
    - Try the Relevance sort (default)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
