## Stems & Deliverables

### When Stems Are Included

| License Type | Stems Included? | How to Get Them |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Non-Exclusive** (subscription download) | Usually not | Request from producer via messaging |
| **Exclusive** (separate purchase) | Yes, automatically | Included in download package |

### What You Receive by Default

| Download Type | Files Included |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Subscription download** | MP3 (320 kbps) + WAV (lossless) |
| **Exclusive purchase** | MP3 + WAV + Stems + Project files (if available) |

### Requesting Stems for Non-Exclusive Downloads

If you downloaded a beat with your subscription and need stems:

1. **Message the producer** via the in-app messaging system
2. **Explain your use case** (mixing, mastering, remix, etc.)
3. **Producer may provide stems** free or for a small fee

<Tip>
  Most producers are happy to provide stems on request. Contact them before purchasing exclusive rights if stems are your primary need.
</Tip>

### Accessing Stems

If stems are included in your purchase:

1. Go to **Purchases** in your account
2. Click on the track
3. Download stems from the **Files** section (separate ZIP or individual files)

### If Stems Are Missing

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| **Non-exclusive download, no stems** | This is normal; contact producer to request |
| **Exclusive purchase, no stems** | Contact support—stems should be included |
| **Download link not working** | Try again; contact support if persistent |

<Warning>
  Stems are **not guaranteed** with subscription (non-exclusive) downloads. If stems are critical for your project, verify with the producer before downloading or purchase exclusive rights.
</Warning>
