## Replacing Audio

### When to Replace Audio

- Fixed mixing/mastering issues
- Updated arrangement
- Corrected audio glitches
- Improved stem quality

### Replace Audio Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Track">
    Go to **Backstage \> Tracks** and select the track.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Track">
    Click **Edit** to open the track editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace Audio File">
    Upload the new audio file. This replaces the existing file entirely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Replacement">
    Review changes and save. The track will be re-processed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important: What Happens on Replacement

<Warning>
  Audio replacement has significant implications:
</Warning>

| Aspect                | Impact                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analytics**         | Play counts and engagement data are **preserved**                   |
| **Existing licenses** | Previous license holders retain their **original** downloaded files |
| **New licenses**      | New purchasers receive the **updated** audio                        |
| **Fingerprint**       | New fingerprint generated; may flag as duplicate of your own track  |
| **Streaming**         | All streams switch to new audio immediately                         |

<Note>
  If you've sold licenses, consider whether replacement is appropriate. License holders purchased the original version. For major changes, uploading a new track may be more appropriate.
</Note>

## Metadata Best Practices

### Title Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do">
    - Keep it short and memorable (2-4 words)
    - Use descriptive keywords
    - Make it searchable
    - Example: "Midnight Chase", "Summer Waves"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't">
    - Use generic names ("Beat 1", "Untitled")
    - Include "Type Beat" unless strategic
    - Use special characters
    - Make it too long
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tag Strategy

Effective tagging improves discovery:

| Category  | Examples                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Mood      | dark, uplifting, aggressive, chill |
| Style     | melodic, hard, bouncy, atmospheric |
| Use Case  | freestyle, hook, verse, commercial |
| Influence | drake type, metro boomin style     |

<Tip>
  Use 5-10 tags per track. Too few limits discovery; too many dilutes relevance.
</Tip>

### BPM Accuracy

Accurate BPM helps artists find matching beats:

| Genre   | Typical BPM Range |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Trap    | 130-170           |
| Hip Hop | 80-100            |
| Drill   | 140-150           |
| R&B     | 60-90             |
| Lo-Fi   | 70-90             |

| High-quality audio | High positive        |
| Cover art          | Medium positive      |
| Missing BPM/Key    | Significant negative |

## Bulk Uploads

For multiple tracks:

1. Prepare a folder with properly named files
2. Create a metadata spreadsheet
3. Contact support for bulk upload assistance
4. Use consistent naming conventions

<Note>
  Bulk upload tools are in development. Currently, tracks must be uploaded individually.
</Note>

## After Publishing

### Track Management

- **Edit**: Update metadata anytime from Track Manager
- **Archive**: Hide from public without deleting
- **Delete**: Permanently remove (affects historical data)

### Monitor Performance

Check your track's performance in Backstage Insights:

- Play count and completion rate
- Save count
- Contribution value
- Audience demographics

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload fails or times out">
    Check file size and format. Try a different browser. Ensure stable internet connection.
