## Overview

Beat Requests connect artists who need specific beats with producers who can create them. Artists describe what they need; producers respond with matching tracks.

## For Artists: Posting Requests

### When to Use Beat Requests

Beat Requests are ideal when:

- You can't find the right beat in the catalog
- You need a custom beat for a specific project
- You want to work directly with a producer
- You have a specific reference track in mind

### Creating a Request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Beat Requests">
    Go to **Beat Requests** from the main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create Request">
    Start a new request form.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Describe Your Needs">
    Be specific about what you're looking for:
    
    | Field | Guidance |
    |-------|----------|
    | Title | Short, descriptive name |
    | Genre | Primary style you need |
    | BPM Range | Tempo requirements |
    | Mood | Emotional tone |
    | Description | Detailed explanation |
    | Reference | Links to similar tracks |
    | Budget | Optional but helpful |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Visibility">
    Choose who can see your request:
    - **Public**: All producers can respond
    - **Following Only**: Only producers you follow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Your request goes live for **24 hours**. Verified producers matching your criteria are notified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Who gets notified?** Beat requests are sent to verified producers whose profiles match your genre/style criteria. Not all producers receive every request—notifications are filtered for relevance.
</Note>

    - Overly complex requirements
    - Demanding exclusive rights for low budgets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Request

> **Title:** Dark Melodic Trap Beat  
> **Genre:** Trap

## For Producers: Responding to Requests

### Finding Requests

Browse requests that match your style:

1. Go to **Beat Requests** section
2. Filter by genre, budget, or recency
3. Read descriptions carefully
4. Check the artist's profile and history

### Submitting a Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Matching Request">
    Look for requests that align with your catalog or style.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare Your Response">
    Either:
    - Link an existing track from your catalog
    - Create a new beat specifically for the request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Your Response">
    Include a message explaining why your beat fits their needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Feedback">
    The artist will review submissions and may:
    - Accept and purchase
    - Request modifications
    - Pass and continue searching
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Response Best Practices

<Tip>
  Personalize your message. Generic responses like "Check this out" are less effective than explaining why your beat matches their description.
</Tip>

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Reference their specific requirements | Send unrelated beats |
| Explain how your beat fits | Copy-paste the same message |
| Be open to negotiation | Ignore their budget range |
| Respond promptly | Wait days to reply |

## Request Lifecycle & States

### Request States

| State | Description | Artist Action | Producer Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Open** | Accepting responses (24 hours) | Edit, close, or wait | Submit response |
| **Fulfilled** | Artist found a beat | Marked complete | No new responses |
| **Expired** | 24 hours passed | Create new request | Find other requests |
| **Closed** | Manually closed by artist | Reopen or create new | Find other requests |

<Warning>
  **Beat requests expire after 24 hours.** This keeps the marketplace fresh and ensures producers respond to active requests. If you don't find a match, submit a new request.
</Warning>

### Fulfillment Flow

  <Step title="Producer Submits Response">
    Producer links a track and sends message explaining fit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Reviews">
    Artist listens to submissions and evaluates matches.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Accepts or Declines">
    **Accept**: Initiates licensing conversation  
    **Decline**: Producer notified; can submit different track  
    **No response**: Producer can follow up via message

  </Step>

### Auto-Expiry Behavior

Tokens reset on the **first day of each calendar month (UTC)**. Unused tokens do not carry over.

```
