## Overview

Beat Requests connect artists who need specific beats with producers who can create them. Artists describe what they need; producers respond with matching tracks.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Artists (posting) and Producers (responding)

## For Artists: Posting Requests

### When to Use Beat Requests

Beat Requests are ideal when:

- You can't find the right beat in the catalog
- You need a custom beat for a specific project
- You want to work directly with a producer
- You have a specific reference track in mind

### Creating a Request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Beat Requests">
    Go to **Beat Requests** from the main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create Request">
    Start a new request form.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Describe Your Needs">
    Be specific about what you're looking for:
    
    | Field | Guidance |
    |-------|----------|
    | Title | Short, descriptive name |
    | Genre | Primary style you need |
    | BPM Range | Tempo requirements |
    | Mood | Emotional tone |
    | Description | Detailed explanation |
    | Reference | Links to similar tracks |
    | Budget | Optional but helpful |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Visibility">
    Choose who can see your request:
    - **Public**: All producers can respond
    - **Following Only**: Only producers you follow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Your request goes live for **24 hours**. All verified producers receive a notification (no genre/budget filtering).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Who gets notified?** When you submit a beat request, **all verified producers** receive an email notification (excluding you). Notifications are broadcast to the entire verified producer pool—there is no filtering by genre or budget.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Can unverified producers see my request?** Yes. Any authenticated producer can browse and respond to active beat requests. Verified status only affects who receives the notification blast—it doesn't restrict visibility.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Beat requests are active for **24 hours** from submission. After expiry, producers can no longer respond.
</Warning>

### Writing Effective Descriptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do Include">
    - Specific tempo requirements
    - Mood and energy level
    - Instrumentation preferences
    - Reference tracks (links or names)
    - Project context (commercial, mixtape, etc.)
    - Timeline if relevant
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid">
    - Vague descriptions ("something fire")
    - Unrealistic budgets
    - Overly complex requirements
    - Demanding exclusive rights for low budgets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Request

> **Title:** Dark Melodic Trap Beat  
> **Genre:** Trap  
> **BPM:** 140-150  
> **Mood:** Dark, atmospheric, emotional  
> **Description:** Looking for a moody trap beat with heavy 808s and a memorable melody. Something in the style of Metro Boomin or Southside. Need it for an upcoming EP track. Open to exclusive licensing if the beat is right.  
> **Budget:** $200-400 exclusive

## For Producers: Responding to Requests

### Finding Requests

Browse requests that match your style:

1. Go to **Beat Requests** section
2. Filter by genre, budget, or recency
3. Read descriptions carefully
4. Check the artist's profile and history

### Submitting a Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Matching Request">
    Look for requests that align with your catalog or style.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare Your Response">
    Either:
    - Link an existing track from your catalog
    - Create a new beat specifically for the request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Your Response">
    Include a message explaining why your beat fits their needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Feedback">
    The artist will review submissions and may:
    - Accept and purchase
    - Request modifications
    - Pass and continue searching
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Response Best Practices

<Tip>
  Personalize your message. Generic responses like "Check this out" are less effective than explaining why your beat matches their description.
</Tip>

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Reference their specific requirements | Send unrelated beats |
| Explain how your beat fits | Copy-paste the same message |
| Be open to negotiation | Ignore their budget range |
| Respond promptly | Wait days to reply |

## Managing Requests

### For Artists

- **Edit**: Update requirements while request is active
- **Expire**: Requests auto-expire after **24 hours** (not editable)
- **Submit New**: Create a new request if the first expires without a match

<Note>
  There is no "close" or "mark as fulfilled" action. Requests simply expire after 24 hours. If you find a beat, proceed directly to licensing—the request status doesn't change.
</Note>

### For Producers

- **Browse Requests**: View all active requests (no notification required)
- **Track Responses**: See which requests you've responded to
- **Follow Up**: Message artists directly for feedback

## Request Lifecycle & States

### Request States

Beat requests have only two possible states:

| State | Description | Artist Action | Producer Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Active** | Accepting responses (first 24 hours) | Edit or wait | Submit response |
| **Expired** | 24 hours passed | Create new request | Find other requests |

<Note>
  There are no "Fulfilled" or "Closed" states. Requests are either active (accepting responses) or expired. The `fulfillRequest` method does not change the request status—it only records which response was accepted.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Beat requests expire after 24 hours.** This keeps the marketplace fresh and ensures producers respond to active requests. If you don't find a match, submit a new request.
</Warning>

### Response Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Producer Submits Response">
    Producer links a track and sends message explaining fit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Reviews">
    Artist listens to submissions and evaluates matches.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Contacts Producer">
    If interested, artist messages producer to discuss licensing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase Complete">
    Artist purchases license through normal licensing flow (separate from beat request system).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The beat request system facilitates discovery only. There is no "mark as fulfilled" action—accepting a response records the selection but does not close or change the request status. The request simply expires after 24 hours.
</Warning>

### Auto-Expiry Behavior

| Timeline | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| Hour 0 | Request goes live; all verified producers notified |
| Hours 1-24 | Request is active; producers can browse and respond |
| Hour 24 | Request auto-expires |
| After expiry | Create new request with available tokens |

<Note>
  **No reminder notifications are sent.** The 24-hour window is enforced by `BeatRequestService::EXPIRY_HOURS = 24`. Expired requests remain in your history for reference but cannot be reopened or extended.
</Note>

### Visibility After Expiry

| State | Visible in Browse | Visible to Artist | Visible to Responding Producers |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Active | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Expired | No | Yes (history) | Yes (their response history) |

## Rate Limits & Throttling

Beat requests are subject to rate limiting to prevent spam and ensure fair access.

### Monthly Token Limits

Beat request tokens control how many requests you can submit per month:

| Plan | Monthly Tokens |
|------|---------------|
| Explorer (Free) | 1 |
| Classic | 1 |
| Plus | 3 |
| Pro | 5 |

Tokens reset on the **first day of each calendar month (UTC)**. Unused tokens do not carry over.

### Check Your Status

You can check your current rate limit status:

```http
GET /api/v1/beat-requests/user/rate-limit-status
```

Returns:
- Current active request count
- Maximum allowed requests
- Time until next slot available (if at limit)

<Note>
  Expired requests (30+ days old) don't count toward your limit. Close fulfilled requests promptly to free up slots.
</Note>
