## For Buyers: Making Payments

### Payout Flow for License Sales

When a buyer purchases your track:

1. **Payment collected** - Stripe processes the buyer's payment
2. **Fees deducted** - Platform fee and Stripe processing fees removed
3. **Transfer initiated** - Remaining amount transferred to your Stripe Connect account
4. **Payout to bank** - Stripe pays out to your bank per your schedule

### Payout Schedule

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **License Sales** | Transferred immediately after purchase (minus fees) |
| **Contribution Pool** | Calculated per subscription invoice and processed shortly after each successful billing (`invoice.paid`) |
| **Bank Payout** | Per your Stripe settings (typically 2-5 business days) |

### Payout Dashboard
