# Release Notes Style Guide

Writing standards to ensure consistency, clarity, and user-focus across all release notes.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Clear** | Simple words, short sentences |
| **Direct** | Get to the point immediately |
| **Helpful** | Focus on user benefit, not features |
| **Confident** | State facts without hedging |
| **Approachable** | Professional but not stiff |

### Tone Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use contractions ("you'll", "can't", "don't")
- Address the reader as "you"
- Lead with benefits
- Be specific and concrete

**Don't:**
- Use "we" or "our" (company-focused)
- Hedge with "hopefully", "should", "might"
- Use passive voice
- Include internal jokes or references

---

## Verb Tense

### Present Tense (Active)

Use for new features and current capabilities:

- ✅ "Adds playlist collaboration"
- ✅ "Improves dashboard loading speed"
- ✅ "Introduces new upload flow"

### Past Tense

Use for bug fixes and resolved issues:

- ✅ "Fixed login timeout error"
- ✅ "Resolved mobile player crash"
- ✅ "Corrected billing calculation"

### Present Perfect (Sparingly)

Use for cumulative changes:

- ✅ "Has streamlined the approval process"
- ⚠️ Use sparingly—prefer simple present or past

---

## Sentence Structure

### Length

- Keep sentences under 25 words
- Break long sentences into bullets
- One idea per sentence

### Examples

❌ **Too long:**
"We've updated the producer dashboard to include new analytics features that help you track your performance and understand your audience better with detailed metrics."

✅ **Better:**
"New analytics in your producer dashboard. Track performance metrics and understand your audience."

### Bullet Points

**Format:**
- Lead with outcome/benefit
- Keep to one line when possible
- Use parallel structure

**Examples:**

❌ **Inconsistent:**
- Upload speed is faster
- We've improved the player
- Bug with login is fixed

✅ **Parallel:**
- **Faster uploads** — Process tracks 50% quicker
- **Improved player** — Smoother playback on mobile
- **Fixed login bug** — No more timeout errors

---

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms

| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| you | we, our, us |
| your profile | your account |
| **Billing** | Settings → Subscription |
| **profile avatar** | user menu |
| track | song (use "track" for beats) |
| beat | song (for producer content) |
| producer | artist (when referring to uploaders) |
| artist | listener (when referring to consumers) |

### Numbers

- Write 1-9 as words: "three new features"
- Write 10+ as numerals: "12% faster"
- Always use numerals for percentages, prices, dates
- Use "95%" not "ninety-five percent"

### Time References

- "now" for immediate availability
- "today" for day of release
- "this week" for rolling releases
- Avoid "soon", "eventually", "coming soon"

---

## UI References

### Formatting

**Bold** all UI elements:

- **Button text** — `**Save Changes**`
- **Menu items** — `**Billing**`
- **Page names** — `**Producer Dashboard**`
- **Section headers** — `**Current Plan**`
- **Navigation paths** — `**profile avatar** → **Billing**`

### Navigation Patterns

Always use the exact UI labels:

✅ **Correct:**
"Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation, then select **Billing**."

❌ **Incorrect:**
"Go to Settings → Subscription"

### Examples

| Element | Correct Reference |
|---------|-------------------|
| User menu | **profile avatar** |
| Billing page | **Billing** |
| Dashboard | **Producer Dashboard** |
| Upload button | **Upload** button |
| Plan change button | **Change plan** |
