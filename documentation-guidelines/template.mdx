title: "Changelog & Release Notes Template"
description: "Template and guidelines for writing release notes and changelog entries using the Update component."
---

## Overview

BeatPass uses a **two-part release notes system**:

1. **Individual release note pages** — Detailed pages in `release-notes/v3.0/` with full content
2. **Unified changelog** — `release-notes/changelog.mdx` using Mintlify `Update` components with tag filters and RSS feed

Every new release requires **both**: a detailed page AND a corresponding `Update` entry in the changelog.

<Note>
  This page is for documentation maintainers. The changelog at `/release-notes/changelog` is the public-facing page with RSS support.
</Note>

## Part 1: Individual Release Note Page

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Update Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
severity: "patch"                    # major | minor | patch | hotfix
audience: "All"                      # All | Producers | Developers
tags: ["feature", "improvement"]     # From taxonomy
components: ["dashboard", "billing"] # Affected areas
---
```

### File Naming & Placement

Individual release note files use the version-based naming convention:

```
release-notes/v3.0/{version}.mdx

Examples:
release-notes/v3.0/3.0.8-26.mdx
release-notes/v3.0/3.0.9.mdx
```

### Content Structure

Use the appropriate template for the release type:
- `template-feature.mdx` — New features
- `template-security.mdx` — Security updates
- `template-hotfix.mdx` — Critical fixes
- `template-major-release.mdx` — Version launches

---

## Part 2: Changelog Update Entry

After creating the individual page, add an `Update` component entry to `release-notes/changelog.mdx`.

### Update Component Template

```mdx
<Update label="{Month Day, Year}" description="v{version}" tags={["{Tag1}", "{Tag2}"]}>
  ## {Title}

  {1-2 sentence summary of the release.}

  - **{Key change 1}** — Brief description
  - **{Key change 2}** — Brief description
  - **{Key change 3}** — Brief description

  [Read full release notes →](/release-notes/v3.0/{version})
</Update>
```

### Placement Rules

- **Add new entries at the TOP** of `changelog.mdx` (newest first)
- Place directly after the frontmatter, before all existing `Update` entries

### Tag Values (for tag filters)

Use **Title Case** tags from this approved set:

| Tag | Use For |
|-----|---------|
| `Feature` | New functionality |
| `Bug Fix` | Resolved issues |
| `Security` | Security-related updates |
| `Performance` | Speed or efficiency improvements |
| `UI/UX` | Visual or interaction changes |
| `Billing` | Payment, pricing, subscription changes |
| `Producer` | Producer-specific features |
| `Mobile` | Mobile experience improvements |
| `Platform` | Major platform-level changes |
| `API` | API-related changes |
| `Notifications` | Notification system updates |

Select 1-3 tags per entry. Tags appear as clickable filters in the sidebar.

### RSS Feed Considerations

The changelog auto-generates an RSS feed at `/release-notes/changelog/rss.xml`. RSS entries contain **pure Markdown only** — components, code blocks, and HTML are excluded.

If your `Update` content includes components or HTML, add an `rss` prop:

```mdx
<Update
  label="March 1, 2026"
  description="v3.1.0"
  tags={["Platform", "Feature"]}
  rss={{
    title: "v3.1.0 — Major Platform Update",
    description: "Complete redesign of the dashboard with new analytics features."
  }}
>
  ## Major Platform Update

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/dashboard.png" alt="New dashboard" />
  </Frame>

  [Read full release notes →](/release-notes/v3.0/3.1.0)
</Update>
```

---

## Example: Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Create the individual page

Create `release-notes/v3.0/3.0.8-26.mdx` with full content using the appropriate template.

### Step 2: Add the changelog entry

Add this at the **top** of `release-notes/changelog.mdx` (after frontmatter):

```mdx
<Update label="March 1, 2026" description="v3.0.8-26" tags={["Feature", "Producer"]}>
  ## New Beat Request Analytics

  Producers can now view detailed analytics for their beat request submissions.

  - **Submission tracking** — See which requests you've responded to
  - **Acceptance rate** — Track your success rate over time
  - **Response time metrics** — Monitor your average response speed

  [Read full release notes →](/release-notes/v3.0/3.0.8-26)
</Update>
```

### Step 3: Update docs.json navigation

Add the new page to the correct month group in the "What's New" tab:

```json
{
  "group": "March 2026",
  "pages": [
    "release-notes/v3.0/3.0.8-26"
  ]
}
```

## Reusable Snippets in Release Notes

Release notes should leverage reusable snippets from `/snippets/` for standardized content. Import snippets after frontmatter.

### Available Snippets for Release Notes

| Snippet | Import | Use For |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `ReleaseFeedback` | `import ReleaseFeedback from "/snippets/sections/release-feedback.mdx";` | Feedback footer (Card + email) — **use on every release note** |
| `SecurityTrust` | `import SecurityTrust from "/snippets/sections/security-trust.mdx";` | Security trust closing Info block — security releases only |
| `PlatformFee` | `import PlatformFee from "/snippets/callouts/platform-fee.mdx";` | When release mentions platform fee structure |
| `SupportContact` | `import SupportContact from "/snippets/sections/support-contact.mdx";` | Inline support contact reference |

### Example Usage

```mdx
---
title: "Update Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
severity: "patch"
---

import ReleaseFeedback from "/snippets/sections/release-feedback.mdx";

# Update Title

[... release content ...]

<ReleaseFeedback />
```

### Rules

- **Every release note** should end with `<ReleaseFeedback />` instead of a custom Questions/Feedback section
- **Security releases** should also include `<SecurityTrust />` after the feedback section
- **Never hardcode** `contact@beatpass.ca` in release notes — use the snippet instead
- Import other snippets (`PlatformFee`, `SupportContact`) as needed based on content

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone

- Clear and direct
- User-focused (benefits, not technical details)
- Professional but approachable

### Length

- **Individual page**: Full detail, 200-600 words
- **Changelog entry**: Concise summary, 50-100 words + 3-5 bullet points + link to full page

### Changelog Entry Rules

- Start with a `## Heading` inside the `Update` (creates RSS entry title)
- 1-2 sentence summary paragraph
- 3-5 bullet points with **bold lead** — description format
- Always end with `[Read full release notes →](/release-notes/v3.0/{version})`
- No technical jargon — same user-focused language as help docs
