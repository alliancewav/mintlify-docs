## Overview

The **Artist Dashboard API** enables you to programmatically access the same metrics displayed in the Backstage dashboard. Use these endpoints to build custom reporting tools, automate performance tracking, or integrate BeatPass analytics into your own applications.

<Info>
  **Base URL:** `https://api.beatpass.ca/v1`
  
  **Authentication:** All endpoints require an authenticated Backstage session with the `artist.dashboard:read` scope.
</Info>

## Authentication & Scope

All dashboard endpoints require:

- **Active session:** User must be authenticated via Backstage
- **Scope:** `artist.dashboard:read` permission
- **Upload access:** Some endpoints (upload insights) additionally require the artist profile to have `upload_access` enabled
