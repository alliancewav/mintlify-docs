## Overview

This section provides high-level technical details for developers integrating with BeatPass or interested in our platform architecture.

## Job Scheduling & Queues

BeatPass uses a robust, orchestrated background job system to handle resource-intensive tasks without impacting user experience.

### The Orchestrator
A single intelligent command (`jobs:orchestrate`) manages all background processes. It dynamically prioritizes tasks based on system load and urgency.

### Priority Levels
1. **Real-time**: Critical user actions (e.g., checkout, immediate notifications).
2. **High**: Important but async tasks (e.g., emails, transloads).
3. **Default**: Standard background work (e.g., metadata updates).
4. **Analytics**: Data aggregation and reporting (lowest priority).

### Batched Processing
To ensure database stability, heavy operations like contribution calculations are processed in optimized batches. This eliminates "N+1" query issues and keeps the database responsive even during peak load.

## Caching Strategy

We employ a multi-layer caching strategy to deliver sub-second response times.

- **Edge Cache**: Static assets (images, audio) are cached at the edge for global performance.
- **Application Cache**: API responses for high-traffic endpoints (like the Producer Dashboard) are cached with smart invalidation.
- **Query Cache**: Complex database queries are cached for short durations to prevent redundant load.

<Note>
  **Cache Invalidation**: Our system uses event-driven invalidation. When you update a track or profile, relevant caches are cleared instantly to show new data.

## API Rate Limits

To protect the platform and ensure fair usage, the BeatPass API implements rate limiting.

- **Standard Limit**: 60 requests per minute per user.
- **Burst Limit**: Short bursts of higher traffic are allowed for navigation.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If limits are reached, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status with a `Retry-After` header.

<Tip>
  If you encounter rate limits, please implement exponential backoff in your client application.
