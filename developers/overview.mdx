The BeatPass API powers the platform's frontend. This is a **first-party API** designed exclusively for BeatPass web and mobile applications.

<Warning>
  **First-Party Only** — BeatPass does not offer a public developer API or third-party integrations. All endpoints documented here are for the official BeatPass application.
</Warning>

## Request Format

### HTTP Methods

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="GET" icon="arrow-down-to-line" color="#22c55e">
    Retrieve data
  </Card>
  <Card title="POST" icon="plus" color="#3b82f6">
    Create resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="PUT" icon="pen" color="#f59e0b">
    Update resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="DELETE" icon="trash" color="#ef4444">
    Remove resources
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Required Headers

```http
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

<Info>
  Authenticated requests use Sanctum's stateful session cookies. State-changing requests must include CSRF protection (`XSRF-TOKEN` cookie + `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header). See the [Authentication guide](/developers/auth) for details.
</Info>

---

## Response Format

### Success Response

Responses vary by endpoint. Most return data directly:

```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "name": "Track Name",
  "artist": {...}
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": {
    "field": ["Validation error"]
  }
}
```

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints use Laravel's standard pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "current_page": 1,
  "per_page": 15,
  "total": 150,
  "last_page": 10,
  "links": {...}
}
```

---

## Authentication Model

BeatPass uses **Laravel Sanctum** for authentication. This is a **stateful SPA session** model with CSRF/XSRF cookies. The API:

- Uses session cookies for authentication (not Bearer tokens)
- Does **not** issue personal access tokens
- Is only available to the first-party BeatPass web application (no third-party/OAuth)

See [Authentication](/developers/auth) for the SPA login flow and CSRF requirements.

## Key Endpoint Groups

### Public Endpoints (Optional Auth)

These endpoints work without authentication but return enhanced data when authenticated:

```http
GET /tracks              # List public tracks
GET /tracks/{id}         # Track details
GET /artists             # List artists
GET /artists/{id}        # Artist profile
GET /search              # Search content
GET /genres              # Available genres
```

### Required Auth Endpoints

These require an authenticated session:

```http
POST /tracks                           # Upload track
POST /tracks/{track}/purchase/initiate # Start purchase
GET  /purchases                        # User's purchases
GET  /messaging/conversations          # User's messages
GET  /producer-intelligence/dashboard  # Producer analytics
POST /beat-requests                    # Create beat request
```

---

## Rate Limiting

The API uses route-specific throttling. Key limits:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Producer Intelligence (public)" defaultOpen icon="globe">
    <Badge color="green" icon="bolt">300 requests/minute</Badge>
    Public analytics endpoints for unauthenticated users.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Producer Intelligence (authenticated)" icon="user-check">
    <Badge color="blue" icon="bolt">500 requests/minute</Badge>
    Enhanced limits for authenticated producer sessions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Social Analytics" icon="chart-simple">
    <Badge color="orange" icon="bolt">120 requests/minute</Badge>
    Social engagement and follower analytics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legacy Producer Dashboard" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    <Badge color="gray" icon="bolt">60 requests/minute</Badge>
    Legacy endpoints (being phased out).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhooks

BeatPass receives **inbound webhooks** from Stripe for payment processing. There is no outbound webhook system for external integrations.

See [Webhooks](/developers/webhooks) for Stripe webhook details.
