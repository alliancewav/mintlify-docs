## Overview

BeatPass processes payment events from Stripe via <Tooltip tip="An automated HTTP callback that Stripe sends to BeatPass when a payment event occurs (e.g. payment succeeded, payout deposited).">webhooks</Tooltip>. There is currently no outbound webhook system for external developer integrations.

<Note>
  BeatPass does not send webhooks to external applications. This page provides an overview of how payment processing works on the platform.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Initiated">
    User initiates a track purchase through the BeatPass checkout flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processed">
    Stripe processes the payment securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="BeatPass Updated">
    BeatPass automatically:

    - Updates purchase records
    - Generates license certificates for successful purchases
    - Marks tracks as sold for exclusive purchases
    - Sends notifications to producers
  </Step>
</Steps>
