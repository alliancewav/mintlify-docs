## Overview

BeatPass uses route-specific rate limiting via Laravel's throttle middleware. Different endpoint groups have different limits based on their resource intensity and expected usage patterns.

---

## Route-Specific Limits

### Producer Intelligence

<Tip>
  **Updated December 2025** — Rate limits increased for cached endpoints.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Leaderboards" defaultOpen icon="trophy">
    <Badge color="green" size="lg">600/min</Badge>
    `/producer-intelligence/leaderboard` — Cached responses (~25ms response time).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch Growth Data" icon="layer-group">
    <Badge color="blue" size="lg">120/min</Badge>
    `/producer-intelligence/tracks/growth-batch` — Process up to 100 tracks per request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Single Track Growth" icon="chart-line">
    <Badge color="purple" size="lg">1200/min</Badge>
    `/producer-intelligence/track/{id}/growth` — Prefer batch endpoint for multiple tracks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard & Analytics" icon="chart-mixed">
    <Badge color="orange" size="lg">500/min</Badge>
    Authenticated dashboard and analytics endpoints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Social Analytics" icon="users">
    <Badge color="gray" size="lg">120/min</Badge>
    Rate-limited for performance optimization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Legacy Endpoints

<Warning>
  **Deprecated:** `/users/{user}/producer-dashboard` is limited to **60/min** and will be removed. Migrate to producer-intelligence endpoints.
</Warning>

### Authentication

Authentication attempts are limited to prevent brute force attacks:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Login Attempts" icon="right-to-bracket" color="#ef4444">
    <Badge color="red">5/min per email + IP</Badge>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Password Reset" icon="key" color="#f59e0b">
    <Badge color="orange">1 per 60s per email</Badge>
  </Card>
  <Card title="2FA Verification" icon="shield-check" color="#22c55e">
    <Badge color="green">5/min per session</Badge>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Rate Limit Format

Rate limits are expressed as requests per time window:

- **Requests:** Maximum number of requests allowed
- **Window:** Time period (typically 1 minute)

Example: "60 requests per minute" means you can make 60 requests within any 60-second window.

---

## Rate Limit Headers

Responses include standard rate limit headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 298
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700000060
```

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="integer">
  Maximum requests allowed in the current window.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="integer">
  Number of requests remaining in the current window.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="unix timestamp">
  Unix timestamp when the rate limit window resets.
</ResponseField>

---

## When Limits Are Exceeded

### 429 Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Attempts.",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

### Handling Rate Limits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Requests">
    Immediately pause further requests to the limited endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Retry-After">
    Read the `Retry-After` header for wait duration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Backoff">
    Use exponential backoff for retries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resume Carefully">
    Resume with reduced frequency.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Optimize Request Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Batch Endpoints">
    The Producer Intelligence API provides batch endpoints:

    ```http
    POST /producer-intelligence/tracks/growth-batch
    ```

    Handles up to 100 tracks per request instead of individual calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses">
    Analytics data doesn't change frequently. Cache responses for 5-15 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Combined Endpoints">
    Use `/producer-intelligence/progress-data` for combined dashboard data instead of multiple calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Paginate Efficiently">
    Request appropriate page sizes. Don't fetch more data than needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Exponential Backoff

```javascript
async function fetchWithBackoff(url, options = {}, attempt = 1) {
  const maxAttempts = 5;
  
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  
  if (response.status === 429 && attempt < maxAttempts) {
    const retryAfter = parseInt(response.headers.get('Retry-After')) || Math.pow(2, attempt);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
    return fetchWithBackoff(url, options, attempt + 1);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

## Monitoring Usage

### Track Rate Limit Status

```javascript
async function apiRequest(url, options) {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  
  const remaining = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining');
  const limit = response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Limit');
  
  if (remaining && parseInt(remaining) < 10) {
    console.warn(`Rate limit warning: ${remaining}/${limit} remaining`);
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

### Common Patterns That Trigger Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Polling leaderboards too frequently" icon="rotate">
    **Problem:** High frequency polling drains your quota.

    **Solution:** Use intervals of 30+ seconds. Leaderboard data is cached for 5 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual track growth calls" icon="chart-simple">
    **Problem:** Calling `/track/{id}/growth` for each track individually.

    **Solution:** Use the batch endpoint `/tracks/growth-batch` for up to 100 tracks per request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple concurrent requests on page load" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    **Problem:** Firing many analytics requests simultaneously.

    **Solution:** Use `/producer-intelligence/progress-data` for consolidated dashboard data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Search-as-you-type" icon="keyboard">
    **Problem:** Sending a request on every keystroke.

    **Solution:** Debounce input by 300ms+ before triggering search.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits by Feature

### Low-Intensity Endpoints (Global Rate Limit)

These endpoints use the platform's global rate limit rather than route-specific throttling:

- Track/album/artist listing and details
- Playlist operations
- User profile data
- Genre and tag lookups

### High-Intensity Endpoints (Throttled)

These have explicit rate limits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Producer Intelligence" icon="brain" color="#8b5cf6">
    Heavy computation for XP, achievements, and rankings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Social Analytics" icon="chart-network" color="#3b82f6">
    Complex queries across social graph.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Legacy Dashboard" icon="clock-rotate-left" color="#6b7280">
    Deprecated — encouraging migration to new APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Analytics" icon="bolt" color="#f59e0b">
    Database-intensive live data queries.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Error Recovery

When you hit a rate limit:

1. **Don't retry immediately** - This wastes your remaining quota
2. **Log the incident** - Track which endpoints are hitting limits
3. **Review access patterns** - Identify optimization opportunities
4. **Contact support** - If legitimate usage requires higher limits

---

## Caching Configuration

BeatPass uses centralized cache TTL (Time-To-Live) configuration for consistent caching behavior across the platform. This ensures predictable data freshness while optimizing performance.

### Cache TTL Values

         User settings and preferences
      </Card>
      <Card title="Contribution Values" icon="coins">
        <Badge color="green">24 hour TTL</Badge>
         Track contribution calculations
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Development Note

When developing integrations, account for these cache windows in your data synchronization logic. Real-time data should not be polled more frequently than the cache TTL.
