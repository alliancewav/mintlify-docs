## Overview

The Beat Requests API powers the custom beat request marketplace. Users spend tokens to create time-limited requests specifying their needs (genre, BPM, mood, budget). Producers browse active requests and submit tracks to fulfill them.

<Info>
  **Base URL:** `https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1/beat-requests`

  **Authentication:** All beat request endpoints require a valid Bearer token.

## Request Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Request">
    User spends tokens to create a beat request with specifications (genre, BPM, mood, budget, reference track). Requests are active for 24, 48, or 72 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Producers Browse">
    Producers view active requests and submit tracks that match the specifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Submissions">
    The requester reviews submitted tracks and connects with producers directly if interested.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expire or Renew">
    Requests expire automatically after the chosen duration (24/48/72h). Expired requests can be renewed within 30 days by spending tokens again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token System

Beat requests use a token-based system tied to the user's subscription plan:

  <Card title="Token Cost" icon="coins">
    24h = 1 token, 48h = 2 tokens, 72h = 3 tokens
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monthly Allocation" icon="calendar">
    Tokens refresh monthly based on subscription plan
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refunds" icon="rotate-left">
    Tokens are refunded when the owner deletes a request (capped at plan allowance)
