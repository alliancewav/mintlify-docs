## Overview

The **Artist Dashboard API** provides programmatic access to producer analytics displayed in the Producer Dashboard. These endpoints return plays, followers, upload insights, and collaboration data for authenticated producers.

<Info>
  **Base URL:** `https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1`
  
  **Authentication:** All endpoints require an authenticated session. The user must have a producer profile (be linked to an artist).
</Info>

## Authentication Requirements

All dashboard endpoints require:

- **Authenticated session:** User must be logged in via the standard Sanctum auth flow
- **Producer profile:** User must have an associated artist profile (created via the Producer Program)
- **Upload access:** Some endpoints (upload insights) additionally require the artist profile to have upload access enabled

### Response Format

All Dashboard API responses use a standard envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

On error, the envelope contains:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```
