    <Badge color="purple" size="lg">1200/min</Badge> — Single track growth (prefer batch endpoint)
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dashboard & XP

### Get Dashboard Data

Comprehensive dashboard data for the authenticated producer.

```http
GET /api/v1/producer-intelligence/dashboard
```

### Get XP Sources

Breakdown of XP earned by source (uploads, plays, engagement, etc.).

```http
GET /api/v1/producer-intelligence/xp-sources
```

### Get Producer Level

Current XP level and progress to next level.

```http
GET /api/v1/producer-intelligence/producer-level

### Get Progress Data (Combined)

Optimized combined endpoint that returns dashboard + XP + achievements in a single request. **Use this instead of multiple individual calls.**

```http
GET /api/v1/producer-intelligence/progress-data

<Tip>
  The `progress-data` endpoint consolidates multiple API calls into one. Use it on dashboard page load to minimize requests and stay within rate limits.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use combined endpoints" icon="layer-group">
    Use `progress-data` instead of calling `dashboard`, `xp-sources`, and `achievements` separately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use batch growth endpoint" icon="bolt">
    Use `tracks/growth-batch` for up to 100 tracks per request instead of individual `track/{id}/growth` calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect cache TTLs" icon="clock">
    Leaderboard data is cached for 5 minutes. Dashboard data is cached for 15 minutes. Don't poll faster than these intervals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debounce real-time requests" icon="gauge">
    Real-time analytics endpoints are database-intensive. Debounce requests and use appropriate intervals (30s+).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
