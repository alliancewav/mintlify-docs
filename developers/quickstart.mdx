## Overview

This guide helps developers understand the BeatPass technical environment, authentication model, and safe testing practices.

<Warning>
  **First-Party Only** — BeatPass does not offer a public API for third-party applications. This documentation describes the API used by the official BeatPass applications.
</Warning>

---

## Authentication Model

### How Auth Works

BeatPass uses **Laravel Sanctum** for SPA (single-page application) authentication:

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Session auth | Cookie-based sessions |
| API tokens | Not issued (no bearer tokens) |
| Third-party integrations | Not supported |
| CSRF protection | Required for POST/PUT/DELETE |

### Cookie + CSRF Flow

For web applications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get CSRF Cookie">
    ```http
    GET /sanctum/csrf-cookie
    ```
    This sets the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Include CSRF Token">
    For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, include the token:
    ```http
    X-XSRF-TOKEN: {token from cookie}
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Submit credentials to the session login route shown in the Auth guide:
    ```http
    POST /auth/login
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-XSRF-TOKEN: {token from cookie}

    {"email": "...", "password": "..."}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Authenticated Requests">
    Session cookies are automatically included in subsequent requests by the browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  BeatPass does not issue Sanctum personal access tokens and does not support third-party integrations. Use the session-based fl
ow above.
</Warning>

### Example Request Flow

Send credentials with the CSRF token, then rely on browser-managed cookies for later calls:

```http
GET /sanctum/csrf-cookie

POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
X-XSRF-TOKEN: {token-from-cookie}

{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "secret"}

GET /tracks
# Cookies from the login response are sent automatically by the browser
```

## Environment

### No Public Sandbox

<Warning>
  **No Public Sandbox** — BeatPass does not provide a public sandbox or test environment. All API calls hit production systems.
</Warning>

This means:

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| POST/PUT/DELETE requests | **Real data is modified** |
| Purchases | **Real charges occur** |
| Uploads | **Real content is published** |
| Messages | **Real users receive messages** |

### Development Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use personal test accounts | Avoid affecting real users |
| Test with minimal data | Don't create spam content |
| Clean up test data | Delete test uploads promptly |
| Never test payments with real cards | Use Stripe test mode when available |

---

## Testing Purchases

### Stripe Test Mode

<Info>
  Contact your team lead to determine if Stripe test mode is enabled for your environment.
</Info>

| Environment | Payment Behavior |
|-------------|------------------|
| Production | Real charges |
| Test mode (if enabled) | Stripe test cards accepted |

### Test Card Numbers (Stripe Test Mode Only)

If test mode is available:

| Card Number | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Succeeds |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Declines |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Insufficient funds |

<Warning>
  Never use test card numbers on production. They will fail and may flag your account.
</Warning>

---

## Using Placeholder IDs

When developing or documenting:

### Recommended Placeholders

| Entity | Placeholder Format | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Track ID | `{track_id}` | `/tracks/{track_id}` |
| User ID | `{user_id}` | `/users/{user_id}` |
| Artist ID | `{artist_id}` | `/artists/{artist_id}` |
| Album ID | `{album_id}` | `/albums/{album_id}` |

### In Code Examples

```javascript
// Good - uses placeholder
const trackId = process.env.TEST_TRACK_ID || '{track_id}';

// Bad - hardcodes production ID
const trackId = 12345;
```

### In Documentation

```http
GET /api/v1/tracks/{track_id}
```

Not:

```http
GET /api/v1/tracks/12345
```

---

## Restricted Access

<Warning>
  **Administrative and internal endpoints are not documented here.** These routes require elevated privileges and are protected by role-based access control. Unauthorized access attempts are logged and may result in account termination.
</Warning>

The API only documents endpoints available to regular authenticated users. If you encounter a 403 Forbidden response, the endpoint requires permissions you don't have.

---

## Safe API Usage

### Do

- Use documented endpoints only
- Respect rate limits
- Handle errors gracefully
- Clean up test data
- Log responsibly (no sensitive data)

### Don't

- Scrape or crawl the platform
- Hammer endpoints with excessive requests
- Store user credentials
- Bypass authentication
- Share session cookies or credentials

---

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Format

```json
{
  "message": "Human-readable error",
  "errors": {
    "field": ["Validation error message"]
  }
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 200 | Success | Process response |
| 201 | Created | Resource created |
| 400 | Bad Request | Fix request format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Re-authenticate |
| 403 | Forbidden | Check permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 422 | Validation Error | Fix input data |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Back off and retry |
| 500 | Server Error | Report to support |

See [Error Catalog](/developers/error-catalog) for feature-specific errors.
