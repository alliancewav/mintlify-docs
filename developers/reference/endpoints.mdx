The API reference now uses the BeatPass OpenAPI spec to render every endpoint with parameters, schemas, and a try-it console. Expand **Endpoint Explorer** in the navigation to browse endpoints by tag.

<Info>
  Base URL: `https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1` (preloaded in the server dropdown).
</Info>

## How to use the playground

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick an endpoint">
    Open the Endpoint Explorer section and select an endpoint category (Search, Playlists, Tracks, Licenses, and more).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set authentication">
    Click **Set authentication** and paste a bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Tokens come from the `auth/login` endpoint or your BeatPass account settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a request">
    Fill in required path/query/body fields, choose the server if needed, and hit **Send** to receive live responses from the API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review schemas">
    Request/response schemas and examples are pulled directly from the BeatPass OpenAPI spec, keeping the docs in sync with the live API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick request example

<RequestExample>

```bash Search tracks and artists
curl "https://open.beatpass.ca/api/v1/search?query=lofi&types=track,artist&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

</RequestExample>

## Error handling

<Tip>
  Standard 401/403 responses are defined in the OpenAPI components. The playground shows the response shape returned by the API for each endpoint.
