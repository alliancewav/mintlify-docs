## What Is BeatPass?

BeatPass is a music licensing marketplace where **producers** upload beats and **artists** license them for their projects. Unlike traditional streaming platforms, BeatPass focuses on beat licensing and fair creator compensation.

## The Two Ways Producers Earn

### 1. Direct License Sales

Set your own prices for different license tiers (Basic, Premium, Exclusive). When an artist purchases, you receive the sale amount directly.

| License Type | You Keep | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Basic | Full sale price | $30 beat → $30 to you |
| Premium | Full sale price | $100 beat → $100 to you |
| Exclusive | Full sale price | $500 beat → $500 to you |

### 2. Contribution Revenue Share

Active subscribers' fees form a monthly pool. Producers share this pool based on their tracks' performance—plays, recency, and collaboration splits.

```
Your Share = Your Contribution Value / Total Platform Contribution × Pool
```
