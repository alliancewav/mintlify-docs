## What Is BeatPass?

BeatPass is a music licensing marketplace where **producers** upload beats and **artists** license them for their projects. Unlike traditional streaming platforms, BeatPass focuses on beat licensing and fair creator compensation.

## The Two Ways Producers Earn

### 1. Direct License Sales (Exclusive Purchases)

Set your own prices for exclusive licenses. When an artist purchases exclusive rights, you receive 100% of your listed price.

| Component | Example |
|-----------|--------|
| Your listed price | $500.00 |
| Platform fee (15%, added to buyer) | $75.00 |
| **Buyer pays** | **$575.00** |
| **You receive** | **$500.00** |

<Tip>
  The platform fee is added on top—not deducted from your earnings. You keep 100% of what you list.
</Tip>

### 2. Subscription Revenue Share (100% to Producers)

Subscription fees form a monthly pool. **100% of the base subscription goes to producers.** The 15% platform fee is added on top (paid by subscribers).

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Base subscription price | 100% goes to producer pool |
| Platform fee (15%) | Added on top (paid by subscriber) |
| Stripe fees | Absorbed by platform |

Your share of the producer pool is calculated by the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula):

```
Your Share = (Your Contribution Value / Total Platform Contribution) × Producer Pool
```

Contribution value is based on:
- **Plays** — More plays = higher contribution
- **Time decay** — Recent plays count more
- **Collaboration splits** — Shared fairly among collaborators

<Tip>
  Both subscription revenue and license sales use the same model: producers receive 100% of the base price, and BeatPass adds 15% on top for the buyer.
