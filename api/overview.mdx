## Overview

The BeatPass API powers the platform's frontend. This is a **first-party API** designed exclusively for BeatPass web and mobile applications.

<Warning>
  **First-Party Only** — BeatPass does not offer a public developer API or third-party integrations. All endpoints documented here are for the official BeatPass application.
</Warning>

### Integration Requests

If you're interested in integrating with BeatPass (partnerships, data licensing, embedded players), contact support to discuss options. Do not attempt to use undocumented endpoints or scrape platform data.

```

```

---

## Response Format

### Success Response

Responses vary by endpoint. Most return data directly:

```json
{
  "id": 1234,
  "name": "Track Name",
  "artist": {...}
}
```

### Error Response

```json

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints use Laravel's standard pagination:

```json

  "data": [...],
  "current_page": 1,
  "per_page": 15,
  "total": 150,
  "last_page": 10,
  "links": {...}
}
```

---

## Authentication Model

BeatPass uses **Laravel Sanctum** for authentication. This provides:

- Session-based authentication for web (SPA)
- Token-based authentication for API requests
- No OAuth flow or third-party app authorization

See [Authentication](/api/auth) for details on obtaining and using tokens.

---

## Key Endpoint Groups

### Public Endpoints (Optional Auth)

These endpoints work without authentication but return enhanced data when authenticated:

```http
GET /tracks              # List public tracks
GET /tracks/{id}         # Track details
GET /artists             # List artists
GET /artists/{id}        # Artist profile
GET /search              # Search content
GET /genres              # Available genres
```

### Authenticated Endpoints

These require a valid Sanctum token:

```http
POST /tracks                           # Upload track
POST /tracks/{track}/purchase/initiate # Start purchase
GET  /purchases                        # User's purchases
GET  /messaging/conversations          # User's messages
GET  /producer-intelligence/dashboard  # Producer analytics
POST /beat-requests                    # Create beat request
```

---

## Rate Limiting

The API uses route-specific throttling. Key limits:

| Route Group | Limit |
|-------------|-------|
| Producer Intelligence (public) | 300 requests/minute |
| Producer Intelligence (auth) | 500 requests/minute |
| Social Analytics | 120 requests/minute |
| Legacy Producer Dashboard | 60 requests/minute |

See [Rate Limits](/api/rate-limits) for complete details.

---

## Webhooks

BeatPass receives **inbound webhooks** from Stripe for payment processing. There is no outbound webhook system for external integrations.

See [Webhooks](/api/webhooks) for Stripe webhook details.

---

## What's Not Covered

This documentation covers **user-facing endpoints only**. The following are intentionally excluded:

### Not Documented

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **Admin endpoints** | Staff-only routes for platform management |
| **Internal analytics** | Backend reporting and metrics collection |
| **Fraud detection** | Security-sensitive rate limits and patterns |
| **Webhook secrets** | Stripe signing secrets and internal tokens |
| **Debug endpoints** | Development and testing routes |
| **Infrastructure** | Queue workers, cache management, health checks |

### Security Notice

<Warning>
  Attempting to access undocumented admin or internal endpoints without authorization is a violation of terms of service and may result in account termination.
</Warning>

If you discover an undocumented endpoint that appears to be a security concern, please report it responsibly to security@beatpass.ca.
