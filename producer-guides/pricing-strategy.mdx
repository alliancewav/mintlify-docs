## Pricing Strategies

### Tiered Licensing

Create multiple tiers to serve different buyer needs:

| Tier | Price | Includes | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Basic | $29 | MP3 only, 5K streams | Testing, demos |
| Standard | $49 | MP3 + WAV, 50K streams | Singles, EPs |
| Premium | $99 | All files, 100K streams | Albums, serious releases |
| Unlimited | $199 | Unlimited streams | Commercial artists |
| Exclusive | $499+ | Full rights, stems | Unique sound ownership |

### Competitive Analysis

Before setting prices:

1. **Research Similar Producers**: Find producers at your level in your genre
2. **Check Their Pricing**: Note their tier structure and prices
3. **Evaluate Quality**: Compare your production quality honestly
4. **Position Accordingly**: Price slightly below, at, or above based on quality

| Growing follower base | Expanded reach |
| Requests for custom work | Artists want your specific sound |

### How to Raise Prices

## Promotional Pricing

### When to Discount

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New Producer Launch">
    Lower initial prices to attract first customers and build reviews.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Catalog Promotion">
    Discount older beats to drive sales and free up attention for new work.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Holiday Sales">
    Black Friday, year-end sales align with consumer buying habits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bundle Deals">
    Offer discounts on multiple beat purchases to increase order value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Discount Guidelines

| Approach | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Discount depth | 20-40% max (deeper devalues your work) |
| Frequency | 2-4 times per year |
| Duration | 3-7 days (urgency matters) |
| Communication | Announce widely, set clear end date |

<Warning>
  Constant discounting trains customers to wait for sales. Use sparingly.
</Warning>

## Contribution vs. Direct Sales

### Revenue Streams

On BeatPass, you earn from two sources:

1. **Direct License Sales**: One-time payments for licensing
2. **Contribution Pool**: Ongoing earnings from streaming engagement

### Pricing Impact

| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Higher license prices | Fewer sales, more per sale |
| Lower/no license prices | More streams, contribution-based income |
| Balanced approach | Mix of direct sales and streaming revenue |

Consider your goals:
- **Quick revenue**: Focus on competitive license pricing
- **Long-term building**: Encourage streaming, build contribution value
- **Maximum total earnings**: Balance both revenue streams

## Setting Exclusive Prices

### Exclusive Pricing Factors

| Factor | Impact on Price |
|--------|-----------------|
| Track popularity | Higher plays = higher exclusive price |
| Uniqueness | One-of-a-kind sound commands premium |
| Existing licenses | Many non-exclusive sales = prove value |
| Production investment | Complex tracks with stems = higher value |
| Your reputation | Established producers charge more |

### Exclusive Pricing Formula

A starting point for exclusive pricing:

```
Base Exclusive Price = (Average Non-Exclusive Price × 10) + Premium Factor
```

Example: If your non-exclusive averages $50:
- Base: $50 × 10 = $500
- Add premium for popular beats: +$200-500
- Final range: $500-1000
