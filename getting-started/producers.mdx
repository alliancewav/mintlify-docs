## Upload Best Practices

### Audio Requirements

| MP3    | 320kbps+ | Acceptable minimum      |

<Warning>
  Low-quality audio affects your Quality Score and listener experience.
</Warning>

### Metadata Excellence

Complete metadata dramatically improves discovery:

- **Title**: Clear, memorable, searchable
- **BPM**: Accurate to help artists find matching beats
- **Key & Scale**: Helps artists match to their vocals
- **Genre**: Primary genre (most important filter)
- **Tags**: 5-10 relevant mood/style tags
- **Description**: Describe the vibe, inspiration, or use cases

### Pricing Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Streaming Only">
    Don't set a price. Earn from contribution-based revenue as users stream and engage.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Licensing">
    Set prices for different license tiers:

    - **Non-Exclusive**: Lower price, ongoing availability
    - **Exclusive**: Premium price, one-time sale
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Earnings

### Revenue Share Model

**Producers receive 100% of all revenue.** The 15% platform fee is added on top—paid by customers, not deducted from producers.

| Revenue Source              | Your Share                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subscription pool**       | 100% of base subscription (15% fee added on top for subscriber) |
| **Exclusive license sales** | 100% of your listed price (15% fee added on top for buyer)      |

Your share of the subscription pool is based on:

- **Plays** — How often your beats are streamed
- **Time decay** — Recent plays count more than old ones
- **Collaboration splits** — Shared fairly among credited producers
