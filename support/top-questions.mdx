## Plans & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between plans?">
    | Feature | Free | Classic | Plus | Pro |
    |---------|------|---------|------|-----|
    | Streaming | Previews only | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
    | Downloads | No | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
    | Beat Requests | 1/month | 1/month | 3/month | 5/month |
    | Support | Email | Email + Chat | Email + Chat | Priority |
    
    All paid plans include non-exclusive commercial licensing with each download.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does my subscription include commercial rights?">
    Yes, but per-download. Each beat you download includes a non-exclusive license for ONE commercial project. Your subscription does not grant blanket commercial rights to the entire catalog—you must download each beat you want to use commercially.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do you have offline listening?">
    Not currently. BeatPass is streaming-only. Downloaded beats can be used offline in your DAW/projects, but streaming requires an internet connection. Offline mobile playback is planned for future updates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there ads?">
    No. BeatPass is currently ad-free for all users. There is no ad-supported tier.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does 'exclusive licensing discounts' mean?">
    Subscribers get discounts when purchasing exclusive rights to beats (where the beat is removed from the catalog and only you can use it). These are separate purchases on top of your subscription.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Streaming & Playback

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a streaming limit?">
    **Free accounts**: Preview playback only.  
    **Subscribers (Classic+)**: Unlimited streaming of the full catalog.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is audio quality different on some tracks?">
    Subscribers stream at high quality (up to lossless). Free users hear previews. Downloaded files are always full WAV quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I listen offline?">
    Not currently. BeatPass is streaming-only. Downloaded beats (with subscription) can be used offline in your projects, but streaming requires an internet connection.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is a track unavailable?">
    Tracks may be unavailable for several reasons:
    - **Sold exclusively**: Someone purchased exclusive rights; the beat is no longer licensable
    - **Unpublished**: Producer removed or unpublished the track
    - **Your existing license is still valid**: If you previously licensed it, check your Purchases
    
    If you believe this is an error, contact [support](/support/contact).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade from non-exclusive to exclusive?">
    Yes, but it's a separate purchase:
    1. Contact the producer via messaging
    2. Purchase the exclusive license (your non-exclusive remains valid)
    3. The beat is removed from the catalog after exclusive purchase
    
    **Note:** Other artists who licensed the beat non-exclusively before you bought exclusive can still use their licenses—they remain valid.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
