## Overview

BeatPass implements usage limits to ensure fair access, prevent abuse, and maintain platform performance. This page consolidates all per-feature limits in one reference.

## Upload Limits

### Track Uploads

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Accepted formats | WAV, FLAC (lossless only) |
| Max file size | 100 MB |
| Max duration | 15 minutes |
| Min duration | 30 seconds |
| Files per track | 1 (single mixdown) |
| Uploads per day | No hard limit* |

*Excessive uploads in a short period may trigger rate limiting. Upload at a reasonable pace.

<Note>
  BeatPass only accepts lossless audio formats (WAV, FLAC). Compressed formats like MP3 are not accepted. Each track is a single audio file — stem uploads are not supported through the platform.
