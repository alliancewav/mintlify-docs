## Streaming & Playback

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are there streaming limits?">
    Free-tier users have monthly streaming limits based on their account type:
    
    | Tier | Monthly Limit |
    |------|---------------|
    | Free | 300 minutes |
    | Subscriber | Unlimited |
    
    **Checking your balance:**
    - In the app: Look for the streaming meter in your profile or player
    - Via API: `GET /users/{user}/minutes-left`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When do streaming limits reset?">
    Streaming quotas reset at the start of each calendar month (UTC midnight on the 1st).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when I hit the limit?">
    When you reach your streaming limit:
    - Playback stops after the current track
    - A "Limit reached" message appears
    - You can still browse, like, and save tracks
    - Upgrade to a subscription to continue streaming
    
    The API returns a `quota_exceeded` error if you attempt to start new playback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I see remaining minutes in the UI?">
    Your remaining streaming time is shown in:
    - **Profile menu** — Quick view of minutes left
    - **Player controls** — Warning appears when low (< 30 min)
    - **Account settings** — Detailed usage breakdown
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What counts as a play?">
    A play is logged when you start listening. Play duration is tracked separately for analytics and contribution calculations. Skipping tracks quickly doesn't count toward your streaming minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does offline playback exist?">
    Currently, BeatPass is streaming-only. Offline playback is not available.
