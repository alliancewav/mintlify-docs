### Plan Comparison Table

|---------|-----------------|---------|------|-----|
| **Streaming** | Preview playback | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Non-Exclusive Downloads** | Not included | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Beat Request Tokens

Beat request tokens control how many custom beat requests you can submit:

| Plan | Monthly Tokens |
|------|----------------|
| Explorer (Free) | 1 |
| Classic | 1 |
| Plus | 3 |
| Pro | 5 |

### Token Reset

- Tokens reset on the **first day of each calendar month**
- Unused tokens do **not** carry over
- Check your remaining tokens in **Beat Requests > My Requests**

### Token Status

You can view your token status when creating a beat request:

```
You have 3 tokens remaining this month.
You've used 7 of 10 tokens.
Reset date: December 1, 2025
```

## Producer Access (Backstage)

### What Producers Get

Producer status is separate from subscription tier. Approved producers gain:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Upload tracks** | Publish beats to the platform |
| **Backstage dashboard** | Access producer analytics |
| **Licensing** | Sell licenses for your beats |
| **Contribution earnings** | Share in subscription revenue |
| **Payout eligibility** | Receive earnings via Stripe Connect |

### Becoming a Producer

1. Apply for backstage access from your profile
2. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 business days)
3. Complete onboarding steps
4. Start uploading

<Note>
  Producer access is free. You don't need a paid subscription to be a producer.
</Note>

## Subscription Pricing

### Current Plans

| Plan | Price | Billing |
|------|-------|---------|
| Monthly | Check pricing page | Billed monthly |
| Annual | Check pricing page | Billed annually (save ~17%) |

View current pricing at **Settings > Subscription** or the pricing page.

### Platform Fee Structure

For license purchases, BeatPass applies a 15% platform fee **on top** of the producer's price:

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Producer price | $100.00 |
| Platform fee (15%) | $15.00 |
| **Buyer pays** | **$115.00** |
| **Producer receives** | **$100.00** |

<Tip>
  The platform fee is added to the listed price, not deducted from it. Producers receive 100% of their listed price.
</Tip>

---

## Subscription Revenue Distribution

### How Subscription Revenue Works

**Producers receive 100% of subscription revenue.** The 15% platform fee is added on top of the subscription price—not deducted from it.

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Base subscription price** | 100% goes to the producer pool |
| **Platform fee (15%)** | Added on top of the subscription price (paid by subscriber) |
| **Stripe fees** | Absorbed by platform (not deducted from producer share) |

**Example:**
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base subscription | $29.00 |
| Platform fee (15%) | $4.35 |
| **Subscriber pays** | **$33.35** |
| **Producer pool receives** | **$29.00** |

Producers receive their share of the pool based on the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula)—calculated from plays, time decay, and collaboration splits.

<Tip>
  The platform fee model is the same for subscriptions and exclusive purchases: producers get 100% of the base price, and BeatPass adds 15% on top for the buyer.
</Tip>

## Managing Your Subscription

### Subscribe

1. Go to **Settings > Subscription**
2. Choose your plan (Classic, Plus, or Pro)
3. Select billing frequency (monthly or annual)
4. Complete payment via Stripe
5. Benefits activate immediately

### Upgrade Your Plan

Upgrading (e.g., Classic → Plus) works as follows:

| Aspect | Default Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| **Timing** | Scheduled for next renewal date (default) |
| **Immediate Option** | If you select "Apply Now" and have a payment method, charges immediately |
| **Proration** | Only charged if applying immediately; prorated for remaining days |
| **Payment Required** | Only required for immediate upgrades |

<Note>
  **Scheduled upgrades are the default.** The API defaults `applyImmediately` to `false`. To upgrade immediately with proration, you must explicitly choose the "Apply Now" option and have a valid payment method.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If you request an immediate upgrade but payment fails, the upgrade is rejected and you remain on your current plan.
</Warning>

### Downgrade Your Plan

Downgrading (e.g., Pro → Classic) works as follows:

| Aspect | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timing** | Always scheduled for next renewal date |
| **Immediate Effect** | None—you keep current plan benefits until renewal |
| **Proration** | No charge or refund; change applies at renewal |
| **Cancel Pending Change** | You can cancel a scheduled downgrade before renewal |

<Warning>
  Downgrades are **always** scheduled for the next billing cycle. Even if you request immediate application, the code forces `applyImmediately = false` for downgrades to avoid refund complications.
</Warning>

### Cancel Subscription

1. Go to **Settings > Subscription**
2. Click **Manage Subscription**
3. Select **Cancel**
4. Access continues until the end of your current billing period (grace period)

### Resume a Cancelled Subscription

If you cancelled but are still within your billing period (grace period):

1. Go to **Settings > Subscription**
2. Click **Resume Subscription**
3. Your subscription continues with no interruption

<Note>
  You can only resume during the grace period. Once the billing period ends, you must subscribe again.
</Note>

## Billing & Invoices

### Payment Methods

- Credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Some regions support additional methods

### Invoices

- Invoices are emailed after each payment
- View history in **Settings > Subscription > Billing History**
- Download invoices for your records

### Failed Payments

If your subscription payment fails:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | `PaymentFailed` notification sent to you |
| **Retry Behavior** | Handled by Stripe (not BeatPass)—typically one automatic retry |
| **Access** | No local access gating implemented; depends on Stripe subscription status |
| **Final Failure** | Stripe may cancel subscription; you'll need to resubscribe |

**To restore access after payment failure:**

1. Go to **Settings > Subscription**
2. Click **Update Payment Method**
3. Enter new card details
4. Payment will be retried by Stripe

<Note>
  BeatPass does not implement custom retry logic or backoff schedules. Payment retries are handled entirely by Stripe's default behavior. The notification email states: "We will automatically attempt to charge your card again in 24 hours. If we are unable to do so, your subscription will be cancelled."
</Note>

### Grace Period

After cancellation, you enter a **grace period**:

- **Duration**: Until the end of your current billing period
- **Access**: Full subscriber benefits continue
- **Downloads**: You can still download beats during grace period
- **Licenses**: Any beats downloaded remain licensed forever

Once the grace period ends:
- Streaming reverts to preview-only (free tier)
- You cannot download new beats
- Previously downloaded beats and licenses are unaffected
