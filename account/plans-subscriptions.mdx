## Subscription Pricing

### Current Plans

| Plan | Price | Billing |
|------|-------|---------|
| Monthly | Check pricing page | Billed monthly |
| Annual | Check pricing page | Billed annually (save ~17%) |

View current pricing at **Settings > Subscription** or the pricing page.

### Platform Fee Structure

For license purchases, BeatPass applies a 15% platform fee **on top** of the producer's price:

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Producer price | $100.00 |
| Platform fee (15%) | $15.00 |
| **Buyer pays** | **$115.00** |
| **Producer receives** | **$100.00** |

<Tip>
  The platform fee is added to the listed price, not deducted from it. Producers receive 100% of their listed price.
</Tip>

---

## Subscription Revenue Distribution

### How Subscription Revenue Works

**Producers receive 100% of subscription revenue.** The 15% platform fee is added on top of the subscription price—not deducted from it.

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Base subscription price** | 100% goes to the producer pool |
| **Platform fee (15%)** | Added on top of the subscription price (paid by subscriber) |
| **Stripe fees** | Absorbed by platform (not deducted from producer share) |

**Example:**
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base subscription | $29.00 |
| Platform fee (15%) | $4.35 |
| **Subscriber pays** | **$33.35** |
| **Producer pool receives** | **$29.00** |

Producers receive their share of the pool based on the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula)—calculated from plays, time decay, and collaboration splits.

<Tip>
  The platform fee model is the same for subscriptions and exclusive purchases: producers get 100% of the base price, and BeatPass adds 15% on top for the buyer.
</Tip>
