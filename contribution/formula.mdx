## Overview

The contribution formula determines how platform subscription revenue is distributed among producers. Your share is calculated based on a transparent formula that rewards engagement while accounting for time and collaboration.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Producers
</Info>

## How It Works

### The Contribution Pool

Each month, a portion of platform subscription revenue forms the **contribution pool**. This pool is distributed to producers based on their **contribution value** relative to all producers.

```
Your Payout = (Your Contribution Value / Total Contribution Value) × Pool Amount
```

---

## The Formula

BeatPass uses the following formula to calculate each track's contribution value:

```
C = Time Decay × Popularity Boost × Collaboration Split
```

### Formula Components

| Component | Formula | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Time Decay** | `exp(-(ln(2)/6) × Δt)` | Decays over time with a 6-month half-life |
| **Popularity Boost** | `1 + 2 × (log₁₀(1+P) / (log₁₀(1+P)+1))` | Scales from 1× to 3× based on plays |
| **Collaboration Split** | `1 / Np` | Divides contribution among credited producers |

### Variables Explained

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Δt** | Months since the track was uploaded |
| **P** | Total number of plays/streams |
| **Np** | Number of producers credited on the track |

---

## How Each Factor Works

### Time Decay (6-Month Half-Life)

Newer tracks contribute more than older ones. After 6 months, a track's time decay factor is 50%. After 12 months, it's 25%.

| Months Since Upload | Time Decay Factor |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0 (new) | 100% |
| 3 | ~71% |
| 6 | 50% |
| 12 | 25% |
| 24 | 6.25% |

<Tip>
  Consistent uploads help maintain your contribution value as older tracks naturally decay.
</Tip>

### Popularity Boost (1× to 3×)

Tracks with more plays receive a logarithmic boost, rewarding popular content while preventing runaway dominance.

| Plays | Boost Multiplier |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0 | 1.0× |
| 10 | ~1.8× |
| 100 | ~2.3× |
| 1,000 | ~2.7× |
| 10,000+ | ~3.0× (max) |

### Collaboration Split

When multiple producers are credited, the contribution is divided equally among them.

| Producers | Each Receives |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 (solo) | 100% |
| 2 | 50% each |
| 3 | 33% each |
| 4 | 25% each |

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: New Solo Track

**Track Details**: Uploaded today, 500 plays, 1 producer

| Factor | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Time Decay | exp(0) | 1.0 |
| Popularity | 1 + 2×(2.7/3.7) | ~2.46 |
| Collaboration | 1/1 | 1.0 |
| **Contribution** | 1.0 × 2.46 × 1.0 | **2.46** |

### Example 2: Older Collaborative Track

**Track Details**: 6 months old, 2,000 plays, 2 producers

| Factor | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Time Decay | exp(-0.693) | 0.50 |
| Popularity | 1 + 2×(3.3/4.3) | ~2.54 |
| Collaboration | 1/2 | 0.50 |
| **Contribution** | 0.50 × 2.54 × 0.50 | **0.635** (per producer) |

### Example 3: Payout Calculation

**Scenario**: Monthly pool is $10,000. Total platform contribution is 5,000 points.

| Producer | Total Contribution | Share % | Payout |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| Producer A | 250 points | 5.0% | $500 |
| Producer B | 100 points | 2.0% | $200 |
| Producer C | 50 points | 1.0% | $100 |

```
Producer A Payout = (250 / 5,000) × $10,000 = $500
```

<Note>
  These are simplified examples. Actual payouts depend on the total pool size and all producers' combined contribution values.
</Note>

### Direct Sales vs Contribution

| Revenue Type | How It Works | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **License sale** | You set price, keep the sale amount | $150 beat → You receive $150 |
| **Contribution** | Share of subscription pool | 5% share of $10K → $500/month |

**When each is better:**

| License Sales Better | Contribution Better |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| High-priced exclusives | High-volume catalog |
| Niche/premium market | Consistent streaming engagement |
| One-time large payouts | Recurring passive income |

<Note>
  Most successful producers earn from **both** streams: direct license sales for immediate revenue and contribution earnings for ongoing passive income.
</Note>

## Calculation Timing

### When Values Update

| Event | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| Play recorded | Near real-time |
| Contribution calculated | Hourly aggregation |
| Monthly total | End of calendar month |
| Payout processed | First week of following month |
