  **Audience:** Producers with backstage access

## Revenue Share Model

### How Revenue is Split

**Producers receive 100% of all revenue.** The 15% platform fee is added on top—paid by subscribers and buyers, not deducted from producers.

| Revenue Source | Your Share | Platform Fee |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Subscription pool** | 100% of base subscription | 15% added on top (paid by subscriber) |
| **Exclusive license sales** | 100% of your listed price | 15% added on top (paid by buyer) |

<Tip>
  Both revenue streams use the same model: you get 100% of the base price, and BeatPass adds 15% on top for the customer.
</Tip>

Your share of the subscription pool is calculated by the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula) based on plays, time decay, and collaboration splits.

## Payout Flow

### The Complete Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Earn Revenue">
    Revenue accumulates from:
    - **License sales** — Exclusive purchases (you receive 100% of your listed price)
    - **Contribution earnings** — Your share of the subscription revenue pool (100% goes to producers)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Funds Reach Your Stripe Account">
    - License sales: Funds transfer after payment succeeds
    - Contribution splits: Processed monthly after billing cycle closes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stripe Holds Funds">
    Stripe holds funds in your connected account balance:
    - **Available balance** — Ready for payout
    - **Pending balance** — Processing (typically 2-7 days)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payout Initiated">
    Stripe automatically initiates payouts to your bank:
    - Default: Daily automatic payouts (when balance available)
    - Can be configured to weekly or monthly in Stripe Dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bank Receives Funds">
    Funds arrive in your linked bank account:
    - US: 1-2 business days
    - Canada: 2-3 business days
    - International: 3-7 business days
  </Step>
</Steps>
