## How XP Works

### Earning XP

XP is awarded for various platform activities:

| Activity                      | XP Earned  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| Upload a track                | 100 XP     |
| Track played                  | 1 XP       |
| Track saved by user           | 5 XP       |
| Achievement unlocked          | 100-500 XP |
| Complete profile              | 50 XP      |
| Complete metadata (per track) | 10 XP      |

### XP Caps

To maintain fairness, some XP sources have daily or weekly caps:

- Per-track play XP is capped to prevent inflation from single viral tracks
- Activity XP resets allow consistent earners to progress
