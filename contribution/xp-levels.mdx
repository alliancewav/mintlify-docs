## How XP Works

### Earning XP

XP is awarded for various platform activities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upload a Track" icon="upload">
    **+100 XP** per track uploaded
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track Played" icon="play">
    **+1 XP** per play received
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complete Metadata" icon="tag">
    **+50 XP** for BPM, key, and scale
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaboration" icon="handshake">
    **+25 XP** per collaboration credit
  </Card>
  <Card title="Achievements" icon="trophy">
    **Varies** based on achievement rarity (150-6,000 XP)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  XP is awarded to **all credited artists** on a track, including collaborators.
</Note>

### XP Caps

To maintain fairness, some XP sources have daily or weekly caps:

- Per-track play XP is capped to prevent inflation from single viral tracks
- Activity XP resets allow consistent earners to progress

## Leaderboards Explained

### How Rankings Are Calculated

The **Overall Leaderboard** uses a composite score combining your rank across six category leaderboards:

| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **XP/Points** | 25% | Total experience points earned |
| **Plays** | 20% | Total streams across all tracks |
| **Uploads** | 15% | Number of tracks uploaded |
| **Quality** | 15% | Metadata completeness percentage |
| **Collaboration** | 15% | Collaborative tracks and partners |
| **Earnings** | 10% | Contribution share percentage |

Your rank in each category is converted to a score (higher rank = higher score), then the weighted average determines your overall position.

### Leaderboard Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overall Leaderboard">
    All producers ranked by the weighted composite score above. Updated every 30 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Category Leaderboards">

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Seasonal Competitions">
    Time-limited challenges (Upload Challenge, Quality Masters, Collaboration Kings) with special rewards for top performers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Shows on Leaderboards

Each leaderboard entry displays:

- **Rank** - Current position
- **Profile** - Avatar and display name
- **Tier badge** - Bronze through Diamond
- **Score** - Composite or category-specific
- **Change** - Position movement (↑↓) since last update

### Accessing Leaderboards
