When you download a beat with your BeatPass subscription, you receive a **non-exclusive license**. This page explains what that means and what you can do with it.

## What is a Non-Exclusive License?

A non-exclusive license gives you permission to use a beat, but the producer can also license that same beat to other artists. This is the standard license type for subscription-based beat platforms.

<Info>
  "Non-exclusive" means multiple artists can use the same beat. Each artist has their own valid license.
</Info>

## Your Rights

### What You Can Do

With a non-exclusive license, you can:

- **Create original songs** — Write and record your own music over the beat
- **Release commercially** — Distribute your song on streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.)
- **Monetize your release** — Earn money from streams and sales
- **Perform live** — Perform your song at events with up to 50 attendees
- **Use in promotional content** — Share on social media and in marketing
- **Make modifications** — Adjust tempo, key, or arrangement to fit your project
- **Keep your license forever** — Your rights don't expire, even if you cancel your subscription

### License Limits

Each download grants you the right to use the beat in **one project** (one song). To use the same beat in multiple songs, download it separately for each project.

## What You Must Do

### Credit the Producer

You are required to credit the producer in your release:

> **"Produced by [Producer Name]"**

Include this credit:
- In your song's metadata
- On streaming platform credits
- In video descriptions when applicable

<Warning>
  Failure to provide proper credit is a violation of your license agreement.
</Warning>

## What You Cannot Do

With a non-exclusive license, you **cannot**:

| Restriction | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Register for Content ID | Prevents blocking other licensees who use the same beat |
| Use in TV, film, or commercials | Requires exclusive license or separate agreement |
| Perform at events over 50 people | Larger venues require upgraded license |
| Resell or redistribute the beat | The beat file cannot be shared or sold |
| Claim ownership of the beat | The producer remains the owner |
| Transfer your license | Licenses are non-transferable |

## Files You Receive

When you download with a non-exclusive license:

| File Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **WAV** | High-quality uncompressed audio |
| **MP3 320kbps** | Compressed format for general use |

<Note>
  Stem files (individual track layers) are only included with exclusive licenses.
</Note>

## What Happens If Someone Buys the Beat Exclusively?

If another artist purchases exclusive rights to a beat you've already downloaded:

- **Your license remains valid** — You can continue using the beat
- **Your rights are not revoked** — Non-exclusive licenses granted before an exclusive sale remain in effect
- **No action required** — You don't need to do anything differently

## License Duration

Your non-exclusive license is **perpetual**, meaning:

- It never expires
- It remains valid even after you cancel your subscription
- It covers any beat you downloaded **while your subscription was active**

<Tip>
  Download beats you like while subscribed — you keep the license to use them forever.
