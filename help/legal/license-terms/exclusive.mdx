An **exclusive license** gives you sole commercial rights to a beat. Once you purchase exclusive rights, no one else can license that beat, and it's removed from general availability on BeatPass.

## What is an Exclusive License?

Unlike non-exclusive licenses (included with subscriptions), an exclusive license means:

- **Only you** can use the beat commercially
- The beat is **removed from the platform** after your purchase
- You get **additional files** including stems
- You have **expanded rights** for TV, film, and larger performances

<Info>
  Exclusive licenses are separate purchases and are not included with BeatPass subscriptions.

## Your Rights

### What You Can Do

With an exclusive license, you can:

- **Use the beat in unlimited projects** — No restrictions on how many songs you create
- **Release on all platforms** — Streaming, physical distribution, digital sales
- **Register for Content ID** — Protect your releases from unauthorized use
- **Use in TV, film, and commercials** — Professional media licensing included
- **Perform at any venue** — No attendance limits
- **Broadcast on radio** — Unlimited radio play
- **Monetize without restrictions** — Full commercial use rights

### Publishing Rights

By default, exclusive licenses include a publishing split:

| Party | Share |
|-------|-------|
| **Producer** | 20% |
| **You (Licensee)** | 80% |

<Note>
  Publishing terms may vary. Check the specific terms when purchasing, as producers may offer different arrangements.
</Note>

## Files You Receive

Exclusive licenses include comprehensive file packages:

| File Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **WAV** | High-quality uncompressed master |
| **WAV Tagged** | Version with producer tag |
| **MP3 320kbps** | Compressed format |
| **Stems** | Individual track layers (drums, bass, melody, etc.) |

Stems allow you to:

- Create custom mixes
- Remove or isolate elements
- Integrate the beat more seamlessly with your vocals

## How to Purchase

Exclusive licenses are offered by individual producers at their discretion.

1. Find a beat you want exclusively
2. Look for the **exclusive purchase option** on the beat page
3. Complete the purchase at the producer's set price
4. Receive your files and license certificate

<Note>
  Not all beats have exclusive options available. Producers decide whether to offer exclusive sales and at what price.
</Note>

## What Happens After You Buy

When you complete an exclusive purchase:

1. **The beat is removed** from BeatPass for new downloads
2. **Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid** — Artists who downloaded before your purchase can still use the beat under their non-exclusive terms
3. **You receive all files** including stems
4. **A license certificate** is generated for your records

## Comparing to Non-Exclusive

| Feature | Non-Exclusive | Exclusive |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Others can use the beat | Yes | No |
| Content ID registration | Not allowed | Allowed |
| TV/Film/Commercial use | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Live performance limit | 50 attendees | Unlimited |
| Stem files included | No | Yes |
| Projects allowed | 1 per download | Unlimited |
| Price | Subscription | Separate purchase |

## Existing Non-Exclusive Licenses

<Warning>
  When you buy exclusive rights, existing non-exclusive licenses are NOT revoked.
</Warning>

If other artists downloaded the beat before your exclusive purchase:

- They can **continue using** the beat under their non-exclusive terms
- Your exclusive rights apply to **future licensing only**
- This is standard practice in the music industry

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I prevent others from using the beat?">
    You prevent future licensing, but anyone who downloaded before your purchase keeps their non-exclusive rights. This is why exclusive prices are higher for popular beats.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I own the beat after purchasing exclusively?">
    You own exclusive commercial rights, but the producer typically retains ownership of the underlying composition. Check your specific license terms for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I resell the beat?">
    No. Exclusive licenses are non-transferable. You cannot resell or sublicense the beat to others.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if the producer made the beat with samples?">
    The producer is responsible for clearing any samples. Your exclusive license assumes all samples are properly cleared for the uses granted.
