These guidelines apply to all producers who upload content to BeatPass. Following these rules helps maintain a safe, high-quality platform for everyone.

## Content Requirements

### You Must Own the Rights

Every beat you upload must be:

- **Original work** that you created
- **Yours to license** — You must have the rights to grant licenses to others
- **Free of third-party claims** — No uncleared samples, stolen loops, or copyrighted material

<Warning>
  Uploading content you don't own can result in DMCA takedowns, account suspension, and legal liability.
</Warning>

### Audio Quality Standards

For the best experience for users and to maintain platform quality:

- Upload in **lossless formats only** (WAV or FLAC required — compressed formats like MP3 are not accepted)
- Ensure audio is **properly mixed and mastered**
- Avoid clipping, distortion, or excessive noise
- Check your files play correctly before publishing

### Metadata Accuracy

Accurate metadata helps users discover your beats:

- **Title** — Use a clear, descriptive title
- **Genre** — Select the most accurate primary genre
- **BPM** — Enter the correct tempo
- **Key** — Specify the musical key if known
- **Tags** — Add relevant tags that describe your beat

<Tip>
  Complete, accurate metadata improves your visibility in search results and can earn you achievements.

## Prohibited Content

The following content is **not allowed** on BeatPass:

### Copyright Violations

- Beats containing **uncleared samples** from other songs
- Content that **infringes on trademarks** or copyrights
- Re-uploads of beats you've already sold exclusively

### Harmful Content

- Content promoting **violence, hate, or discrimination**
- Beats with **explicit lyrics** that aren't properly labeled
- Content that **harasses or threatens** individuals

### Misleading Content

- Beats uploaded under **false claims of ownership**

- Content designed to **manipulate play counts** or rankings

### Illegal Content

- Content that violates **local or international laws**
- Content that promotes **illegal activities**
- Material that exploits or endangers anyone

## Sample Clearance

If your beat contains samples:

1. **Clear all samples** before uploading
2. Ensure you have **written permission** from the copyright holder
3. Be prepared to provide proof of clearance if requested

### What Counts as a Sample?

- Portions of other songs (vocals, melodies, drums)
- Loops or sounds from sample packs that restrict licensing
- Recreations that are substantially similar to existing works

### Royalty-Free and Licensed Sounds

You may use:

- Royalty-free sample packs that allow commercial licensing
- Sounds from libraries you've legitimately purchased
- Original recordings you've created yourself

<Note>
  Even "royalty-free" samples have terms. Make sure the license allows you to sublicense to others through BeatPass.
</Note>

## Exclusive Availability

When you upload a beat to BeatPass:

- You can also sell it on other platforms (it's non-exclusive to BeatPass)
- If you sell the beat **exclusively** to someone outside BeatPass, you must remove it from the platform
- Once a beat is sold exclusively through BeatPass, it's automatically removed from general availability
