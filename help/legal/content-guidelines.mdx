### Accuracy Matters

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Key/Scale">
    Must accurately reflect the track's musical key. This is essential for artists planning vocal melodies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Genre">
    Select genres that genuinely describe your track. Miscategorization hurts discoverability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tags">
    Use relevant, descriptive tags. Avoid unrelated popular tags for visibility.
