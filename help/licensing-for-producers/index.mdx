As a producer on BeatPass, your beats can be licensed in two ways: through subscriptions (non-exclusive) and through direct purchases (exclusive). This section explains how both work and how you can configure exclusive licensing to maximize your earnings.

## How Licensing Works on BeatPass

</CardGroup>

## Two License Types

### Non-Exclusive (Subscription Downloads)

When a BeatPass subscriber downloads your beat:

- They receive a **non-exclusive license** automatically
- Multiple artists can license the same beat
- You earn a share of subscription revenue based on plays
- Terms are **standardized and managed by BeatPass**
- You don't need to configure anything

<Info>
  Non-exclusive licenses are designed to be simple and consistent across the platform. You cannot customize these terms — BeatPass handles everything.
</Info>

### Exclusive (Direct Purchase)

When someone buys exclusive rights to your beat:

- They receive an **exclusive license** you've configured
- The beat is removed from general availability
- You receive the full purchase price (minus platform fee)
- You have **full control** over the license terms
- Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid

## Licensing Options for Your Beats

When you upload a beat, you can choose how it's licensed:

## What You Control

### For Non-Exclusive Licenses

You don't configure non-exclusive terms — they're standardized:

- Perpetual, worldwide license
- One project per download
- Producer credit required
- No Content ID registration
- Live performance up to 50 attendees

### For Exclusive Licenses

You configure everything:

- **Price** — Set your exclusive licensing price
- **Publishing split** — How royalties are divided
- **Territory** — Where the license applies
- **Usage rights** — Distribution, streaming, video, broadcasting
- **Files delivered** — WAV, stems, MIDI, etc.
- **Producer royalty** — Ongoing percentage from exploitation
