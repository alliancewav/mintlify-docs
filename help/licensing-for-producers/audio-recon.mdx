BeatPass automatically scans global music databases to detect songs on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer that sound similar to your beats. This feature is available exclusively for verified producer profiles.

<Warning>
  **Audio Recon detects audio similarity, not confirmed placements.** A match may indicate that your beat was used in a song, but it could also be caused by shared royalty-free samples, similar sound design, or coincidental similarity. Always listen carefully and verify each match before taking action.
</Warning>

## How It Works

BeatPass uses <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> fingerprinting technology to compare your uploaded beats against millions of songs across major streaming platforms. When a similarity is found, you're notified with full details about the song, the releasing artist, and where to listen.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your beat is fingerprinted">
    When you upload a beat, BeatPassID creates a unique audio fingerprint — a digital signature of your beat's sound.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly scanning">
    BeatPass automatically scans your beats against global music databases each month. No action is required from you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Similarity detected">
    When a song on Spotify, YouTube, or Deezer closely matches your beat's audio fingerprint, a match is recorded.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You're notified">
    You receive an in-app notification (and optionally an email) with the song details, streaming links, and similarity score.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requirements

To use Audio Recon, you need:

- A **verified producer profile** — [Request verification](https://open.beatpass.ca/backstage/requests/verify-artist) if you haven't already
- At least one **uploaded beat** hosted on BeatPass (not external links)
- A completed **audio fingerprint** for your beat (generated automatically on upload)

<Info>
  For collaborative beats, only one producer on the track needs to be verified for the scan to run. All producers linked to the beat are notified when a match is found — even if they aren't individually verified.
</Info>

## Viewing Your Matches

When similarities are detected, they appear in the **Audio Recon** section on your track page.

Each match shows:

- **Song title and artist** — The name of the song and who released it
- **Similarity score** — How closely the song's audio fingerprint matches your beat (80% minimum to display)
- **Streaming links** — Direct links to listen on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer
- **Release date** — When the song was published
- **Album and label** — Additional release information when available

<Note>
  Only you and other producers credited on the beat can see the **Audio Recon** section. It's not visible to listeners or other users.
</Note>

## Understanding Similarity Scores

The similarity score indicates how closely a detected song's audio fingerprint matches your beat:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| **90–100%** | Very high similarity — strong indication your beat may have been used, but verify by listening |
| **80–89%** | High similarity — the song shares significant audio characteristics with your beat, worth investigating |

Only matches with 80% or higher similarity are shown. Lower-similarity matches are filtered out automatically.

<Info>
  A high similarity score does **not** guarantee your beat was used. Common royalty-free samples, similar drum patterns, or widely-used sound design techniques can produce high scores between unrelated tracks.
</Info>

## Notifications

When a new similarity match is detected, you receive:

- **In-app notification** — Visible in your notification center (bell icon)
- **Email notification** — Detailed email with streaming links, match details, and verification guidance

You can manage these notifications from your [notification preferences](https://open.beatpass.ca/notifications/settings). Audio Recon notifications appear under the **Audio Recon** group, which is available for verified producers.

## Verifying a Match

When you receive an Audio Recon notification, take these steps to verify it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listen to both tracks">
    Use the streaming links in your notification or on the track page to listen to the matched song. Compare it carefully against your beat to determine whether it actually uses your work.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider common causes">
    Not every match is a placement. The similarity could be caused by shared royalty-free samples, similar drum kits, common chord progressions, or widely-used sound design. If the match sounds coincidental, no action is needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your download history">
    If the song does use your beat and the user obtained it through BeatPass, a <Tooltip tip="An automatically generated legal document proving the user has the right to use your beat, including audio fingerprint verification.">license certificate</Tooltip> was created at the time of download and you would have received a download notification email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact support for unauthorized use">
    If you're confident your beat was used without a valid license, contact BeatPass support. We can verify licensing records and help you with next steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How This Connects to BeatPass Licensing

Audio Recon works alongside BeatPass's existing licensing infrastructure:

### License Certificates

Every beat downloaded through BeatPass generates an automatic <Tooltip tip="An official document proving someone has the right to use your beat, including a unique License ID, terms, and BeatPassID audio fingerprint.">license certificate</Tooltip>. When Audio Recon finds a match that you've confirmed is a genuine use of your beat, you can cross-reference it with your download notifications and license records to confirm whether the user obtained your beat legitimately.

### BeatPassID Fingerprinting

The same <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> technology that powers license certificate verification also powers Audio Recon. Your beat's audio fingerprint is compared against streaming catalogs to identify similar audio.

### Sample-Safe Warranty

BeatPass beats come with a <Tooltip tip="A guarantee that the beat was originally produced and uploaded by the credited producer, backed by BeatPassID audio fingerprint verification.">sample-safe warranty</Tooltip> — meaning the beat was originally produced and uploaded by the credited producer, backed by BeatPassID verification. If an Audio Recon match turns out to be a genuine placement and the user has a valid BeatPass license, both parties are protected by the platform's licensing terms.

## Scanning Schedule

- Scans run **automatically each month** — no manual action required
- Each scan compares your beats against the latest streaming catalog data
- New similarities are detected as songs are added to Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer
- You're only notified once per new match (rescans don't trigger duplicate notifications)
- Tracks are rescanned every 30 days to catch newly released music

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see the Audio Recon section on my track?">
    The **Audio Recon** section only appears for producers who uploaded the beat. If you're a verified producer and don't see it, your beat may not have been scanned yet (scans run monthly) or no similar audio has been detected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trigger a scan manually?">
    Scans are automated and run monthly. You cannot trigger a manual scan at this time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I'm not verified?">
    Audio Recon requires a verified producer profile. You can [request verification](https://open.beatpass.ca/backstage/requests/verify-artist) from your Backstage area. Once verified, your beats will be included in the next monthly scan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can a match be wrong?">
    Yes. Audio Recon detects audio **similarity**, not confirmed placements. Matches can occur due to shared royalty-free samples, similar drum patterns, or common production techniques. Always listen to the matched song and compare it to your beat before assuming it's a placement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if someone used my beat without a license?">
    First, listen to confirm the song genuinely uses your beat (not just a similar sound). Then contact BeatPass support with the match details. We can check our licensing records to verify whether a valid license exists. If the use is unauthorized, we can advise you on next steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work for collaborative beats?">
    Yes. For collaborative beats, only one credited producer needs to be verified for the beat to be scanned. All credited producers with BeatPass accounts are notified when a placement is found, regardless of their individual verification status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What streaming platforms are covered?">
    BeatPass currently scans against Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer catalogs. Additional platforms may be added in the future.
  </Accordion>
