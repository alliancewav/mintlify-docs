When a buyer purchases your beat exclusively, several things happen automatically. This guide walks you through the entire lifecycle — from the moment of purchase to when you receive your payout.

---

## The Sale Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buyer Completes Payment">
    The buyer pays the exclusive price you set, plus the platform fee (12% + $3, paid by the buyer). Payment is processed securely through Stripe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="License Certificate Generated">
    BeatPass automatically generates an **exclusive license certificate** tied to the buyer and your track. This is the legal document granting them exclusive rights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Marked as SOLD">
    Your track is immediately marked as **SOLD** across the platform. It is removed from search results, subscription downloads, and the browse catalog. No new non-exclusive downloads can occur.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Get Notified">
    You receive a **sale notification** via email and in-app notification (based on your notification preferences). The notification includes the buyer's name, track name, sale amount, and your earnings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Earnings Are Recorded">
    Your share of the sale is recorded in your **Finances dashboard**. The amount reflects your full listed price — 100% goes to you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payout Processing">
    Your earnings are included in your next scheduled payout via Stripe Connect. Payout timing depends on your country and bank (typically 2–7 business days after funds settle).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Changes for Your Track

### Immediately After Sale

| Aspect | Before Sale | After Sale |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Status** | Available | SOLD |
| **Subscription downloads** | Active | Disabled |
| **Search visibility** | Listed | Removed |
| **Browse catalog** | Visible | Hidden |
| **Track page** | Shows price | Shows "SOLD" |
| **New non-exclusive licenses** | Available | Not available |

### What the Buyer Gets

The buyer receives:
- **Exclusive license certificate** (PDF) — legally binding document
- **WAV file** download
- **MP3 file** download
- **Stems** download (if you provided stems)
- Track page shows them as the exclusive owner

---

## What Happens to Existing Non-Exclusive Licenses

<Info>
  **Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid.** If subscribers downloaded your beat before the exclusive sale, their licenses are perpetual and unaffected. This is stated in our [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) (Section 2.3).
</Info>

This means:
- Subscribers who **already downloaded** the beat can continue using it in their projects
- **No new** non-exclusive downloads are possible after the exclusive sale
- The buyer's exclusive rights apply to **all future use** — they own the exclusive going forward
- Existing licensees are limited to the terms of their non-exclusive license (one project per download)

## Your Earnings Breakdown

### What You Receive

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Your listed price** | 100% goes to you |
| **Platform fee** | Paid by the buyer (not deducted from you) |
| **Stripe processing fee** | Small percentage deducted by Stripe |

### Example

If you set an exclusive price of **$200**:

| Party | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Buyer pays** | $227 ($200 + 12% + $3 platform fee) |
| **You receive** | ~$194 ($200 minus Stripe processing fee) |
| **BeatPass receives** | $27 (platform fee from buyer) |

<Note>
  Stripe processing fees vary by country and payment method (typically 2.9% + $0.30 for US cards). These are standard payment processing costs, not BeatPass fees.
</Note>

## If the Buyer Requests a Refund

Refund requests for exclusive purchases are handled under BeatPass's [Refund Policy](/help/billing/refund-policy). Key points for Producers:

- All exclusive sales are **generally final**
- Refunds are only considered within **24 hours** of purchase, and only if the buyer has **not downloaded** any files
- If a refund is approved:
  - The exclusive license is **revoked**
  - Your track is **re-listed as available**
  - Your payout for that transaction is **reversed or adjusted**
- BeatPass **protects Producers** from fraudulent chargebacks by contesting illegitimate disputes with the payment processor

<Info>
  In most cases, once a sale is completed and files are downloaded, it is **final and irreversible**. See our [Refund Policy](/help/billing/refund-policy) for full details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I sell the same beat exclusively again after it's sold?">
    No. Once a beat is sold exclusively, it is permanently marked as SOLD. The exclusive buyer has full rights. You cannot re-list or resell it unless the sale is refunded.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I want to keep some rights?">
    The exclusive license terms are set by the platform. If you want to negotiate custom terms (e.g., retaining publishing rights beyond the standard split), you would need a separate written agreement with the buyer. See [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) (Section 2.4).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I still earn from past non-exclusive downloads?">
    No additional earnings are generated from past non-exclusive downloads after the sale. However, if those downloads contributed to your Contribution Value during a prior payout period, those earnings are already locked in.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I set different exclusive prices for different beats?">
    Yes. Each track can have its own exclusive price. Set this when uploading or editing a track in your Producer Dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to offer exclusive licenses?">
    You can choose not to set an exclusive price on your tracks. If no exclusive price is set, the track is only available through subscription (non-exclusive) downloads.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know if someone is interested in buying exclusive?">
    Buyers can contact you through BeatPass messaging to discuss exclusive purchases. You may also receive direct purchase notifications if a buyer proceeds with the purchase.
  </Accordion>
