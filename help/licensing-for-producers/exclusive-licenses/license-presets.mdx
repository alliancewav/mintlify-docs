License presets let you save your exclusive license configuration and apply it to multiple beats. Instead of configuring each beat from scratch, create presets for common scenarios and select them when needed.

## What Is a License Preset?

A preset is a saved exclusive license configuration that includes:

- Publishing split percentages
- Territory and governing law
- Usage rights settings
- Files to deliver
- Producer royalty percentage
- All toggle options

Once saved, you can apply a preset to any beat with one click.

## Why Use Presets?

### Consistency

Ensure all your exclusive licenses have the same professional terms without manual re-entry.

### Time Savings

Configure once, use everywhere. No need to set up each beat individually.

### Multiple Configurations

Create different presets for different scenarios:

- Standard exclusive
- Premium exclusive (higher producer share)
- Budget exclusive (more buyer-friendly terms)
- Full buyout (no ongoing royalties)

## Creating a Preset

### From Scratch

1. Go to your license presets management
2. Click **New Preset**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Configure all license settings
5. Save the preset

### From an Existing Beat

When editing a beat's exclusive license:

1. Configure the settings as desired
2. Look for the option to save as preset
3. Name your preset
4. It's now available for future beats

## Preset Details

Each preset stores:

| Setting | What's Saved |
|---------|--------------|
| **Name** | Your preset name (e.g., "Standard Exclusive") |
| **Description** | Optional notes about when to use this preset |
| **Publishing Split** | Producer % and Licensee % |
| **Territory** | Geographic scope |
| **Governing Law** | Legal jurisdiction |
| **Usage Rights** | All distribution, streaming, video, performance settings |
| **Files to Deliver** | Which file types are included |
| **Producer Royalty** | Ongoing percentage |
| **Toggle Options** | Broadcasting, for-profit performances, Content ID |

## Managing Presets

### Viewing All Presets

Access your presets from the Backstage area to see:

- Preset name and description
- Key terms (publishing split, royalty %)
- Usage count (how many tracks use this preset)
- Default status

### Editing a Preset

1. Find the preset you want to edit
2. Click the edit icon
3. Modify settings as needed
4. Save changes

<Warning>
  Editing a preset does not automatically update beats already using it. Existing beats keep their original terms.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Preset

1. Find the preset you want to delete
2. Click the delete icon
3. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  You cannot delete a preset that's currently in use by tracks. Update those tracks to use a different preset first.
</Note>

## Setting a Default Preset

Mark one preset as your default:

1. Find the preset
2. Click the star icon to set as default
3. The default preset is automatically selected for new beats

When uploading new beats, your default preset is pre-selected, saving you time.

## Applying a Preset

### When Uploading a Beat

1. In the licensing section, look for "Use Saved Preset"
2. Select your preset from the dropdown
3. Settings are automatically applied
4. Continue with upload

### When Editing a Beat

1. Edit the beat's licensing settings
2. Select a preset from the dropdown
3. Settings are replaced with preset values
4. Save changes

### Using Default Settings

Click **Use Default** to load the BeatPass default exclusive configuration instead of a custom preset.

## Preset Information Display

When viewing presets, you'll see:

```
Standard Exclusive (Default)
Publishing: 20% / 80%  •  Royalty: 3%  •  Used by 12 tracks
```

This tells you:

- **Preset name** — "Standard Exclusive"
- **Default status** — "(Default)" if it's your default
- **Publishing split** — Producer % / Licensee %
- **Royalty percentage** — Ongoing producer royalty
- **Usage count** — How many tracks use this preset

## Example Presets

### Standard Exclusive

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Publishing | 20% producer / 80% licensee |
| Territory | Worldwide |
| Royalty | 3% |
| Content ID | Allowed |
| Files | WAV, WAV Tagged, MP3, Stems |

### Premium Exclusive

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Publishing | 30% producer / 70% licensee |
| Territory | Worldwide |
| Royalty | 5% |
| Content ID | Allowed |
| Files | WAV, WAV Tagged, MP3, Stems, MIDI |

### Full Buyout

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Publishing | 0% producer / 100% licensee |
| Territory | Worldwide |
| Royalty | 0% |
| Content ID | Allowed |
| Files | All available |

<Tip>
  A "Full Buyout" preset gives the buyer complete control with no ongoing obligations to you. Price these significantly higher to compensate for giving up all future royalties.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Name presets clearly** — "Standard Exclusive" is better than "Preset 1"
2. **Use descriptions** — Note when to use each preset
3. **Set a default** — Speeds up your workflow for common scenarios
4. **Create variations** — Different presets for different beat types or price points
5. **Review periodically** — Update presets as your business evolves
