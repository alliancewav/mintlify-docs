---

When you offer exclusive licensing on a beat, you configure exactly what rights the buyer receives. This page explains each configuration option.

## Accessing License Configuration

You'll see the exclusive license configuration when:

1. **Uploading a new beat** — In the licensing section
2. **Editing an existing beat** — In the track settings
3. **Managing presets** — In your license presets

## Publishing Rights Split

This determines how publishing royalties are divided between you and the buyer.

### What It Means

When the buyer releases music using your beat, publishing royalties are generated. This split determines who gets what percentage.

### Configuration

| Field | Range | Default |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Producer Share** | 0-100% | 20% |
| **Licensee Share** | 0-100% | 80% |

The two values must add up to 100%.

### Recommendations

| Scenario | Suggested Split |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Standard exclusive** | 20% producer / 80% licensee |
| **Premium beat, established buyer** | 30% producer / 70% licensee |
| **Full buyout** | 0% producer / 100% licensee (higher price) |

<Info>
  An 80/20 split favoring the buyer is industry standard for exclusive beats. It's attractive to buyers while still giving you ongoing royalty participation.
</Info>

## Territory

Where the license is valid geographically.

### Options

- **Worldwide** (default and most common)
- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Europe
- North America
- South America
- Asia
- Africa
- Australia/Oceania

### Recommendations

Most exclusive licenses are **Worldwide**. Only limit territory if:

- You want to sell regional exclusives to different buyers
- You have specific legal or business reasons

## Governing Law Country

Which country's laws govern the license agreement.

### Options

- United States (default)
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- France
- Australia
- Japan
- South Korea
- Brazil
- Mexico

### What It Affects

- Which legal system applies if disputes arise
- Where arbitration would take place
- How contract terms are interpreted

<Note>
  Most producers choose United States or their home country. The default (United States) is widely accepted in the music industry.
</Note>

## Usage Rights

These settings define what the buyer can do with your beat.

### Distribution & Streaming

| Setting | Default | What It Controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Distribute Copies** | Unlimited | Physical and digital sales |
| **Audio Streams** | Unlimited | Spotify, Apple Music, etc. |

### Video Rights

| Setting | Default | What It Controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Monetized Music Videos** | Unlimited | YouTube music videos with ads |
| **Non-Monetized Music Videos** | Unlimited | Videos without monetization |
| **Monetized Video Streams** | Unlimited | TikTok, Reels, Shorts with monetization |
| **Non-Monetized Video Streams** | Unlimited | Social content without monetization |

### Broadcasting & Performance

| Setting | Default | What It Controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Broadcasting Rights** | Yes | TV and radio broadcast |
| **Radio Stations** | Unlimited | Number of stations |
| **For-Profit Performances** | Yes | Paid concerts and events |
| **Non-Profit Performances** | Unlimited | Free events |

<Tip>
  For exclusive licenses, unlimited usage rights are standard and expected. Limits are more common in tiered non-exclusive licenses (which BeatPass doesn't use).
</Tip>

## Toggle Options

### Broadcasting Rights

- **On** — Buyer can broadcast on TV and radio
- **Off** — Broadcast rights not included

Default: **On**

### For-Profit Performances

- **On** — Buyer can perform at paid events
- **Off** — Only non-profit performances allowed

Default: **On**

### Content ID Registration Allowed

- **On** — Buyer can register with YouTube Content ID, audio fingerprinting services
- **Off** — Content ID registration not permitted

Default: **On** (for exclusive licenses)

<Warning>
  Unlike non-exclusive licenses, exclusive buyers typically expect Content ID rights. This allows them to protect their release from unauthorized use.
</Warning>

## Files to Deliver

Select which files the buyer receives:

| File Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **WAV (Uncompressed)** | Full quality master file |
| **WAV (Tagged)** | Version with your producer tag |
| **MP3 320kbps** | High-quality compressed version |
| **MP3 256kbps** | Standard compressed version |
| **FLAC (Lossless)** | Lossless compressed format |
| **Stems** | Individual track layers (drums, bass, melody, etc.) |
| **MIDI Files** | Musical data files |
| **Trackout/Multitrack** | Full session files |

### Default Selection

- WAV (Uncompressed)
- WAV (Tagged)
- MP3 320kbps
- Stems

### Recommendations

For exclusive sales, include at minimum:

- **WAV** — Essential for professional release
- **Stems** — Expected for exclusive licenses
- **MP3 320kbps** — Useful for previews and reference

<Info>
  Stems are almost always expected with exclusive licenses. They allow the buyer to create custom mixes and integrate the beat professionally with their vocals.
</Info>

## Producer Royalty Percentage

An ongoing percentage you receive from the buyer's commercial exploitation of the beat.

| Field | Range | Default |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Producer Royalty** | 0-100% | 3% |

### What It Means

Beyond the upfront payment and publishing split, this is an additional percentage of revenue from:

- Sales of the final song
- Streaming revenue
- Sync licensing deals

### When to Adjust

- **Higher (5-10%)** — Premium beats, established producers
- **Lower (1-2%)** — Competitive pricing, new producers
- **Zero** — Full buyout deals (charge more upfront)

## Validation

BeatPass validates your configuration before saving:

- Publishing shares must total 100%
- All percentages must be 0-100
- Territory must be selected
- At least one file type must be selected

If there are errors, you'll see them listed with specific guidance on what to fix.
