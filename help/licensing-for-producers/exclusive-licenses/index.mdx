Exclusive licenses let you sell full exclusive rights to a beat for an upfront price you set. Unlike non-exclusive licenses (which are standardized), you have complete control over exclusive license terms.

## What Is an Exclusive License?

When someone buys exclusive rights to your beat:

- **Only they can use it commercially** — No one else can license that beat
- **The beat is removed** from subscription downloads
- **You receive 100% of your listed price** (the platform fee is paid by the buyer on top)
- **Terms are what you configured** — Publishing split, territory, usage rights, etc.

## Why Offer Exclusive Licenses?

### Higher Earnings Per Beat

Exclusive licenses typically sell for significantly more than the cumulative non-exclusive revenue. Set prices based on the beat's quality, your reputation, and market demand.

### Premium Positioning

Offering exclusive options signals that your beats have value. Serious artists looking for unique sounds will pay for exclusivity.

### Artist Relationships

Exclusive sales often lead to ongoing relationships. Artists who buy exclusively may return for more beats or recommend you to others.

## Licensing Type Options

When uploading or editing a beat, choose from:

| Option | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Non-Exclusive Only** | Subscription downloads only, no exclusive option |
| **Exclusive Only** | Only available for exclusive purchase — blocked from subscription downloads |
| **Both Options** | Available for both subscription downloads AND exclusive purchase |

<Tip>
  "Both Options" is popular — you earn from subscription downloads while waiting for the right exclusive buyer.

## What You Can Configure

### Publishing Rights Split

Determine how publishing royalties are divided:

You can adjust these percentages to any split that totals 100%.

### Territory

- Worldwide (default)
- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Europe
- Regional options (North America, Asia, etc.)

### Usage Rights

What the buyer can do:

- **Distribution copies** — How many copies they can distribute
- **Audio streams** — Streaming platform plays
- **Music videos** — Both monetized and non-monetized
- **Video streams** — YouTube, TikTok, etc.
- **Broadcasting** — Radio, TV
- **Live performances** — For-profit and non-profit

### Files to Deliver

What files the buyer receives:

- WAV (Uncompressed)
- WAV (Tagged)
- MP3 320kbps
- Stems (Separated Tracks)
- MIDI Files
- Trackout/Multitrack

### Additional Options

- **Broadcasting Rights** — Allow TV and radio broadcast
- **For-Profit Performances** — Allow paid concerts and events
- **Content ID Registration** — Allow the buyer to register with Content ID
- **Producer Royalty** — Ongoing percentage from buyer's exploitation

## When Someone Buys Exclusive

1. **Payment processed** — Through Stripe Connect to your account
2. **License certificate generated** — With your configured terms
3. **Files delivered** — Buyer receives the files you specified
4. **Beat status changes** — Marked as "Exclusively Licensed"
5. **Beat removed from downloads** — No new non-exclusive licenses

<Warning>
  Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid after an exclusive sale. Artists who already downloaded your beat keep their rights.
</Warning>
