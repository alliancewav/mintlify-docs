Setting the right price for your exclusive licenses is crucial. Price too high and beats won't sell; price too low and you leave money on the table. This guide helps you find the right balance.

## Setting a Price

When configuring exclusive licensing for a beat:

1. Enter your price in the exclusive price field
2. Select your currency (USD is default)
3. The price displays on the beat page for potential buyers

## Currency Options

BeatPass supports multiple currencies:

- USD (United States Dollar) — default
- CAD (Canadian Dollar)
- EUR (Euro)
- GBP (British Pound)
- And other supported currencies

Choose the currency that makes sense for your primary market.

## Pricing Factors

### Beat Quality

| Quality Level | Typical Price Range |

| **Entry level** | $100 - $300 |
| **Professional** | $300 - $1,000 |
| **Premium** | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| **Elite/Celebrity** | $5,000+ |

### Your Experience

New producers typically price lower to build a portfolio and reputation. Established producers with credits can command higher prices.

| Experience | Pricing Approach |
|------------|------------------|
| **Just starting** | Competitive pricing to attract first buyers |
| **Building portfolio** | Moderate prices, focus on volume |
| **Established** | Premium prices based on reputation |

### Demand Indicators

Consider these signals when pricing:

- **High play count** — More popular beats warrant higher prices
- **Multiple downloads** — Proven demand suggests premium value
- **Genre trends** — Hot genres can command higher prices
- **Uniqueness** — One-of-a-kind sounds are worth more

### What's Included

Your price should reflect what the buyer gets:

| Included Files | Price Impact |
|----------------|--------------|
| WAV only | Lower |
| WAV + Stems | Standard |
| Full package (WAV, Stems, MIDI, Trackouts) | Higher |

### License Terms

More favorable terms for the buyer = higher price:

| Term | Price Impact |
|------|--------------|
| Full buyout (0% ongoing to you) | Higher price |
| Standard (20/80 split) | Standard price |
| Higher producer share (30/70) | Slightly lower price |

## Pricing Strategies

### Volume Strategy

- Lower prices ($100-$300)
- Sell more exclusives
- Build buyer relationships
- Good for new producers

### Premium Strategy

- Higher prices ($500-$2,000+)
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Attract serious artists
- Good for established producers

### Tiered by Beat Type

Different prices for different beat categories:

| Beat Category | Price |
|---------------|-------|
| Basic beats | $150 |
| Standard beats | $400 |
| Featured/premium beats | $1,000 |
| Custom/commissioned | $2,000+ |

### Competitive Pricing

Research what similar producers charge:

1. Look at producers at your level
2. Check prices in your genre
3. Position yourself appropriately
4. Adjust based on results

## Price Display

On the beat page, exclusive pricing appears as:

- **Badge** — Shows "Exclusive: $XXX" when available
- **Licensing section** — Full details with price and terms
- **Purchase option** — Clear call to action

Potential buyers see this when browsing, making it easy to understand the exclusive option.

## Dynamic Pricing Considerations

### When to Raise Prices

- Beat is getting lots of attention
- You've made recent sales at current prices
- Your reputation is growing
- The beat has unique, in-demand elements

### When to Lower Prices

- Beat has been available for a long time without interest
- Market conditions change
- You want to move inventory
- Testing different price points

<Tip>
  Start with competitive prices as a new producer. As you build credits and reputation, gradually increase your exclusive prices.
