Every time someone licenses your beat — whether through subscription or exclusive purchase — BeatPass automatically generates a license certificate. This certificate serves as legal proof of the license and includes audio fingerprint verification.

## What Is a License Certificate?

A license certificate is an official document that proves someone has the right to use your beat. It includes:

- **License ID** — Unique identifier for the license
- **Track information** — Beat title, your name, release date, BPM
- **License type** — Non-exclusive or exclusive
- **License terms** — What the licensee can do
- **Audio fingerprint** — Cryptographic proof of the specific audio file
- **Verification URL** — Public link to verify authenticity

## Audio Fingerprinting

Each certificate includes BeatPassID fingerprinting technology:

### What It Does

- Creates a unique digital "fingerprint" of your beat's audio
- Stores the fingerprint securely on BeatPass servers
- Allows anyone to verify a license is authentic
- Helps protect against unauthorized use

### Fingerprint Details

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fingerprint Hash** | Unique cryptographic hash of your audio |
| **Algorithm** | ChromaPrint v1.5.1 |
| **Security Level** | Enterprise Grade |
| **Fingerprinted Date** | When the fingerprint was created |

## Certificate Contents

### For Non-Exclusive Licenses

Non-exclusive certificates include standardized terms:

- License type: Non-Exclusive
- Territory: Worldwide
- Duration: Perpetual
- Projects allowed: One per download
- Attribution: Required
- Content ID: Not allowed

### For Exclusive Licenses

Exclusive certificates include your custom terms:

- Governing law (your configured country)

<Info>
  The terms shown on exclusive certificates are exactly what you configured when setting up the license. They're locked in at the time of purchase.

## How Licensees Access Certificates

Licensees can access their certificates from:

1. **My Licenses** — In their library sidebar
2. **After download** — Immediately after downloading your beat
3. **Beat page** — From the track they licensed

They can:

- **View online** — See the full certificate in their browser
- **Download PDF** — Print or save for their records
- **Share verification link** — Prove their license to third parties

## Verification

Anyone can verify a license certificate:

1. Visit the verification URL on the certificate
2. BeatPass confirms whether the license is valid
3. Shows the license details and status

This helps:

- Record labels verify artist licenses
- Distributors confirm rights
- Third parties check authenticity
- Detect fraudulent claims

## As a Producer, You Can See

In your **My Licenses** section (under Your Library), you can see:

- All licenses granted for your beats
- Who the licensee is (name, not email)
- License type (non-exclusive or exclusive)
- When the license was issued
- License status (active, expired, revoked)

This appears with a "Licensed to" indicator so you can track who has rights to your music.

## Why Certificates Matter

### For You (Producer)

- **Proof of terms** — Documents exactly what rights you granted
- **Legal protection** — Clear record if disputes arise
- **Track licensing** — See who has licensed your beats

### For Licensees

- **Proof of rights** — Documents their permission to use your beat
- **Professional credibility** — Can show labels and distributors
- **Clear terms** — Know exactly what they can do

## Certificate Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | License is valid and in effect |
| **Expired** | License has passed expiration (rare for BeatPass) |
| **Revoked** | License was cancelled due to violation |

<Note>
  BeatPass non-exclusive licenses are perpetual — they don't expire. Exclusive license duration depends on your configured terms (typically also perpetual).
