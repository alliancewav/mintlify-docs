---

Non-exclusive licenses are automatically granted when BeatPass subscribers download your beats. These licenses are standardized across the platform — you don't need to configure anything.

## How It Works

When a subscriber downloads your beat:

1. They receive an automatic non-exclusive license
2. A license certificate is generated with your track's fingerprint
3. You earn a share of subscription revenue based on your plays
4. The beat remains available for others to license

## What Subscribers Can Do

With a non-exclusive license, the person who downloads your beat can:

| Permission | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Create original music** | Use your beat in one song per download |
| **Release commercially** | Distribute on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc. |
| **Monetize streams** | Earn money from their release |
| **Perform live** | Play their song at events up to 50 attendees |
| **Use in videos** | Music videos, social media content |
| **Modify the beat** | Adjust tempo, key, arrangement |

## What Subscribers Must Do

- **Credit you** — Include "Produced by [Your Name]" in their release
- **One project per download** — Each download = one song

## What Subscribers Cannot Do

| Restriction | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| **Register for Content ID** | Would block other licensees |
| **Use in TV/Film/Commercials** | Requires exclusive license |
| **Perform at events over 50 people** | Requires exclusive license |
| **Resell the beat** | Redistribution not allowed |
| **Claim ownership** | You remain the owner |

## Why These Restrictions?

Non-exclusive licenses allow multiple artists to use the same beat. The restrictions — especially around Content ID — protect everyone:

- **Content ID blocks other users** — If one person registers your beat with Content ID, it would flag videos and songs from other legitimate licensees
- **Large venues need exclusivity** — Major performances typically require exclusive rights

<Info>
  These standardized terms ensure fairness and prevent conflicts between licensees who all have valid rights to use your beat.

## How You Earn

You earn from non-exclusive licenses through subscription revenue sharing:

1. **Plays are tracked** — Every time someone plays your beat, it's recorded
2. **Contribution calculated** — Your share is based on your plays relative to total platform plays
3. **Monthly distribution** — Revenue is distributed to producers monthly

This means you earn continuously as your beats get played, not just when they're downloaded.

## What Happens When Someone Buys Exclusive

If someone later purchases exclusive rights to your beat:

- **Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid** — Artists who already downloaded keep their rights
- **No new non-exclusive licenses** — The beat is removed from subscription downloads
- **You keep your exclusive sale earnings** — Plus any ongoing revenue from existing licenses

<Note>
  Non-exclusive licenses granted before an exclusive sale are never revoked. This is standard in the music industry.
