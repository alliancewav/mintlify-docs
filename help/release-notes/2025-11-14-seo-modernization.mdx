## Summary

A comprehensive modernization of the platform's SEO strategy, implementing rich schemas, voice search optimization, and authentic metadata to improve search visibility and click-through rates.

## What's New

- **Rich Schemas**: Added `FAQ`, `MusicGroup`, `MusicAlbum`, and `InteractionCounter` schemas to eligible pages.
- **Voice Search**: Implemented `speakable` schema to optimize content for voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri.
- **Authentic Ratings**: Removed all fake `aggregateRating` schemas to comply with Google's strict authenticity guidelines.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Enhanced organization metadata with `knowsAbout`, `slogan`, and social profiles to trigger Knowledge Panels.

## Why It Matters

- **Visibility**: Rich snippets (FAQs, events) take up more screen real estate in search results.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to Google's guidelines prevents manual penalties and ensures long-term ranking stability.
- **Future-Proofing**: Voice search optimization prepares the platform for the growing number of voice queries.

## Technical Details

- **New Views**: Created `resources/views/seo/faq-schema.blade.php` and `speakable.blade.php`.
- **Meta Tags**: Optimized titles and descriptions for better CTR.
