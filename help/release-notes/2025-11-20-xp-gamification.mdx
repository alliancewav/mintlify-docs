## Summary

The XP and Gamification system has received a massive update to ensure fairness, accuracy, and reliability. This includes collaborative XP attribution, max-level handling, and self-healing data consistency.

## What's New

- **Collaborative XP**: XP from track plays is now awarded to **all** credited artists (owner + collaborators), not just the uploader.
- **Max Level Handling**: Users who reach Level 100 now see a "Legendary Producer" status with a capped progress bar (100%) and 0 XP needed.
- **Self-Healing Data**: The system now automatically detects and fixes any discrepancies in level or XP data on page load.
- **Source Normalization**: Fixed issues where XP from different sources (e.g., "tracks" vs "track_upload") was split into separate buckets. All history is now consolidated.
- **Metadata Fixes**: Resolved a bug where metadata completion XP was sometimes not awarded correctly.

## Why It Matters

- **Fairness**: Collaborators now get the credit they deserve for their contributions.
- **Accuracy**: You can trust that your level and XP total are always correct.
- **Clarity**: Historical data is now properly labeled and color-coded alongside new activity.
