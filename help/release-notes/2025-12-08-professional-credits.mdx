# Professional Credits Feature

<Info>
  **Release Date:** December 8, 2025
</Info>

We're excited to introduce **Professional Credits** — a new way for producers to showcase their work on other artists' projects directly on their BeatPass profile.

## What's New

### Spotify-Linked Credits

You can now add songs and albums you've worked on from Spotify to your producer profile. Credits appear in a dedicated **Credits** tab on your profile, giving visitors proof of your professional experience.

### Multi-Role Support

Select **multiple roles** for each credit. If you both produced and mixed a track, you can showcase both contributions:

- Producer, Co-Producer, Beat Maker
- Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer, Recording Engineer
- Songwriter, Composer, Arranger
- Featured Artist, Vocalist
- Executive Producer, A&R, Creative Director

### Album Import with Per-Track Editing

When adding an entire album, you can customize your role for each individual track. Perfect for projects where your contributions varied across songs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for the album on Spotify">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply default roles to all tracks">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize individual tracks as needed">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add all credits at once">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Immersive Profile Display

Credits appear as beautiful, immersive cards on your profile with:

- **Cover art backgrounds** from Spotify
- **Type indicators** — Songs (green) or Albums (purple)
- **Role badges** showing your contributions
- **Play buttons** linking directly to Spotify
- **Stacked card effect** for albums with multiple tracks

### Role Filter Pills

Visitors can filter your credits by role type to quickly see all your work in a specific category — great for showcasing your mixing portfolio or production credits separately.

## How to Add Credits

1. Go to your artist profile edit page
2. Click the **Credits** tab
3. Click **Add Credit**
4. Search for songs or albums on Spotify
5. Select your role(s) for each credit
6. Save and your credits appear on your profile

- **Smart grouping** — Multiple roles on the same song are grouped together

## What's Next
