## Summary

A focused refactoring session to improve codebase maintainability, fix critical security vulnerabilities, and clean up legacy technical debt.

## What's New

- **Security Fix**: Patched a critical vulnerability in `ContentInsightsController` that could have allowed unauthorized access to analytics.
- **Routing Cleanup**: Fixed typos in radio routes and removed duplicate route definitions for admin pages.
- **Legacy Code Removal**: Deleted over 190 lines of unused licensing components and archived 14 obsolete frontend files.
- **Context-Aware Redirects**: Admin analytics links now correctly redirect to the specific track, album, or artist insights page instead of a generic dashboard.

## Why It Matters

- **Security**: Ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Maintainability**: Removing dead code makes the codebase easier to understand and reduces the risk of bugs.
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner routing and file structure improve navigation and development speed.

## Technical Details

- **Files Archived**: Moved legacy fingerprinting dashboards to `docs/archive/frontend-2024`.
- **Route Fix**: Corrected `:seeName` to `:seedName` in radio feature routes.
