We've made significant improvements to the mobile player experience, producer payout system, email templates, and UI consistency across the platform.

## Mobile Player Bar Redesign

The mobile mini player has been completely redesigned with a modern, iOS-inspired aesthetic that integrates seamlessly with mobile browsers.

### Glass Morphism Design

- **Backdrop blur effect** — The mini player now features a frosted glass appearance with `backdrop-blur-2xl` for a premium feel
- **Rounded corners** — Modern `rounded-2xl` design language matching iOS system UI
- **Subtle borders** — Light/dark mode adaptive borders that blend with the system theme
- **Touch feedback** — Smooth scale animations on tap for tactile response

### Smooth Animations

- **Slide-up overlay** — Tap the mini player to expand into a fullscreen view with fluid spring animations
- **Framer Motion transitions** — Professional-grade animations using custom easing curves `[0.32, 0.72, 0, 1]`
- **Animated navbar** — Bottom navigation smoothly hides when lyrics are displayed
- **Queue panel** — Slides in from the right with smooth transitions

### Enhanced Playback Experience

- **Circular album art** — Large, centered cover art with ring accent in fullscreen mode
- **BPM/Key pills** — Track metadata displayed as subtle pills below the track info
- **Lyrics integration** — Toggle between cover art and synced lyrics with smooth crossfade
- **Compact lyrics mode** — When viewing lyrics, playback controls collapse to a minimal bar

### Safe Area Support

- **Notch compatibility** — Proper padding for devices with notches and home indicators
- **Safe area insets** — Content respects `safe-area-top` and `safe-area-bottom` for edge-to-edge displays

## Producer Payout Notifications

Producers now receive detailed notifications about their subscription revenue earnings.

### Payout Notification Types

| Type | When Sent | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Pending** | When splits are calculated | Notify about upcoming payout |
| **Initiated** | When transfer is sent | Confirm transfer to bank |
| **Completed** | When funds arrive | Confirm successful deposit |
| **Failed** | If transfer fails | Alert with next steps |

### Detailed Earnings Breakdown

Payout emails now include a complete breakdown:

- **Your platform share** — Your percentage of the subscriber pool
- **Redistribution bonus** — Extra earnings when other producers haven't connected Stripe
- **Total payout amount** — Final amount deposited to your account
- **Billing period** — Which month the earnings are from

### Stripe Connect Reminders

Producers without connected Stripe accounts receive reminder notifications when revenue is distributed:

- **Missed amount displayed** — Shows what they would have earned
- **Setup guidance** — Clear steps to connect Stripe (< 5 minutes)
- **Urgency messaging** — Explains that unclaimed funds are redistributed

### Platform Balance Protection

The payout system now includes safeguards to prevent transfer failures:

- **Pre-transfer balance check** — Verifies sufficient funds before attempting transfers
- **Safety buffer** — Maintains 5% buffer to prevent negative balance issues
- **Automatic retry** — Failed transfers are queued for retry when balance allows
- **Deferred processing** — Splits marked as `pending_balance` process automatically when funds are available

## Collection Showcase Improvements

The collection showcase sections (featured albums, playlists, and artist highlights) have been refined for a smoother, more consistent experience.

### What's Changed

- **Consistent play buttons** — Play buttons now match the design used throughout the platform, with proper hover states and accessibility
- **Smoother hover interactions** — Removed the card lift animation on hover for a cleaner feel
- **Fixed navigation links** — Album, playlist, and artist cards now link to the correct URLs with proper slugs (e.g., `/album/1397/beatpasstm/808-inc` instead of just `/album/1397`)
- **Consistent backgrounds** — Collection showcases now use the same background styling as other content sections

## Artist Page Enhancements

Several improvements to artist profile pages make browsing more intuitive.

### Carousels

- **Fade effect on edges** — The "Discover more beats" and "More Albums You Might Like" carousels now have a subtle fade mask at the edges, matching other carousels on the platform
- **Verified badges** — Verified producer badges now display correctly in the Followers tab

### Discography

- **Album cover aspect ratio** — Album artwork in the discography list view now maintains a perfect 1:1 square ratio regardless of the original image dimensions

## User Profile Updates

User profile pages now have a more polished, consistent appearance.

### Followers & Following Tabs

- **Grid layout** — Followers and following lists now display in a responsive grid (2-6 columns depending on screen size) matching the artist profile layout
- **Updated empty states** — Empty state messages now use the same design as artist pages with centered icons and clear messaging

### All Profile Tabs

Empty states across all profile tabs have been updated for consistency:

| Tab | What's Shown |
|-----|--------------|
| **Tracks** | "No liked beats yet" with music note icon |
| **Albums** | "No liked collections yet" with album icon |
| **Artists** | "No liked producers yet" with microphone icon |
| **Playlists** | "No playlists yet" with playlist icon |
| **Reposts** | "No reposts yet" with repost icon |
| **Following** | "Not following anyone yet" with people icon |
| **Followers** | "No followers yet" with people icon |

## What This Means for You

- **Cleaner browsing** — Smoother animations and consistent styling across the platform
- **Better navigation** — Links always take you to the right place with readable URLs
- **Improved discovery** — Carousel fade effects make it clearer when more content is available
- **Polished profiles** — Both artist and user profiles now have a cohesive, modern look

## Email Template Redesign

All 35+ email templates have been completely redesigned with a modern, Stripe-inspired layout for better readability and professionalism.

### New Design System

- **Separated card layout** — Each email section is now its own distinct card with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- **Dark header with logo** — Consistent branding with centered logo and title
- **Inline CSS styling** — Maximum compatibility across all email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- **Mobile responsive** — Emails render correctly on all device sizes

### Layout Structure

1. **Dark header** — Logo + email title with rounded top corners
2. **Main content card** — Greeting, message, and key information
3. **Additional section cards** — Details, breakdowns, or guidance (separated cards)
4. **Contact card** — Support email and social links
5. **Unsubscribe card** — Email preference management
6. **Footer** — Company info and copyright

### Unsubscribe Links

All user-configurable notification emails now include proper unsubscribe options:

- **Unsubscribe from this type** — Stop receiving this specific notification
- **Unsubscribe from all** — Opt out of all marketing emails
- **Manage preferences** — Link to notification settings page
