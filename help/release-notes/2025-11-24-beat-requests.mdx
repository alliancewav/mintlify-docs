## Summary

The Beat Request system has been upgraded to a production-ready state with a new database-backed architecture, resolving critical security issues and ensuring data integrity.

## What's New

- **Database Persistence**: Moved from unreliable file storage to a robust database schema with transaction support.
- **Security Fixes**: Resolved a critical issue where deleting a request could refund tokens to the wrong user.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added strict checks to prevent accidental duplicate submissions of the same track.
- **Existing Track Selection**: Producers can now select from their existing catalog when fulfilling requests, instead of re-uploading.
- **Improved Feedback**: Clearer error messages (e.g., "Already submitted") instead of generic server errors.

## Why It Matters

These changes ensure that your tokens are safe, your requests are reliable, and the fulfillment process is smoother. The move to a database architecture prevents data loss and race conditions, especially during high traffic.

## How to Use

No action is required from users. The system works seamlessly with the existing interface.
- **Producers**: When fulfilling a request, look for the new "Select Existing Track" option.
- **Request Owners**: You can now delete requests with confidence that your token will be correctly refunded to your balance.

## Known Issues

- None. All identified critical issues from the audit have been resolved.
