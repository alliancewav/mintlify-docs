## What is BeatPass?

BeatPass is a **music licensing and beat marketplace platform** designed to connect producers, artists, curators, and listeners in a fair, transparent ecosystem.

Unlike traditional beat marketplaces that rely on one-time sales, BeatPass uses a **contribution-based revenue model** that rewards creators based on genuine engagement metrics like plays, completions, saves, and audience quality.

To create a sustainable music economy where:

- **Producers** earn fairly for their work based on real engagement
- **Artists** can discover and license quality beats easily
- **Curators** can build audiences by showcasing talent
- **Listeners** can explore and support emerging creators
