## What Is BeatPass?

BeatPass is a music licensing marketplace where **producers** upload beats and **artists** license them for their projects. Unlike traditional streaming platforms, BeatPass focuses on beat licensing and fair creator compensation.

## The Two Ways Producers Earn

### 1. Direct License Sales (Exclusive Purchases)

Set your own prices for exclusive licenses. When an artist purchases exclusive rights, the buyer pays your listed price **plus** a BeatPass platform fee.

| Component | Example |
|-----------|--------|
| Beat price you set | $500.00 |
| Platform fee (15%, added to buyer) | $75.00 |
| **Buyer pays** | **$575.00** |
| **You receive** | **$500.00 minus Stripe processing fees** |

<Tip>
  The platform fee is added on top for the buyer and kept by BeatPass. Standard Stripe processing fees are deducted from your portion before the funds arrive in your Stripe Connect balance.
</Tip>

### 2. Subscription Revenue Share

Subscription fees form an ongoing revenue pool for producers. For each paid subscription invoice, BeatPass allocates a producer pool and distributes it according to the [Contribution Formula](/help/earnings/formula).

| Component | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Subscription payment | Split between producer pool and BeatPass platform fee |
| Platform fee (15%) | Charged on top of the base subscription price and retained by BeatPass |
| Stripe fees | Stripe’s processing fees are primarily covered from BeatPass’s side (for example, from the platform fee); the producer pool is calculated on the full base subscription amount |

Your share of the producer pool is calculated by the [Contribution Formula](/help/earnings/formula):

```
Your Share = (Your Contribution Value / Total Platform Contribution) × Producer Pool
```

Contribution value is based on:
- **Plays** — More plays = higher contribution
- **Time decay** — Recent plays count more
- **Collaboration splits** — Shared fairly among collaborators

<Tip>
  For direct license sales, the platform fee is added on top of the price you set and goes to BeatPass, while Stripe processing fees are deducted from your portion. For subscriptions, BeatPass allocates a producer pool from each paid invoice and keeps a separate platform fee; exact percentages are defined in your producer agreement.
