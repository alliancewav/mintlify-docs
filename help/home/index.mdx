  <Accordion title="How do I earn money on BeatPass?" icon="coins" defaultOpen>
    Producers earn through two revenue streams:
    
    1. **Contribution Pool**  Your share of subscription revenue based on plays, engagement quality, and recency, funded from each paid subscription invoice
    2. **Direct License Sales**  Earnings from exclusive license purchases. Buyers pay your listed price plus a platform fee; you receive the price you set minus Stripe processing fees.

    - **Subscription splits**  Calculated after each paid subscription invoice (`invoice.paid`) and transferred via Stripe Connect
