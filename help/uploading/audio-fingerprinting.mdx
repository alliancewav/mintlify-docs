BeatPass uses audio fingerprinting to protect your music and ensure the integrity of the catalog. This guide explains how the technology works and what it means for you as a producer.

## What is Audio Fingerprinting?

Audio fingerprinting creates a unique digital "fingerprint" of your track based on its audio characteristics. Think of it like a human fingerprint — each track has its own unique signature that can be used to identify it.

This fingerprint is created automatically when you upload a track and is used to:

- **Detect duplicates** — Prevent the same audio from being uploaded twice
- **Protect your content** — Identify unauthorized copies of your music
- **Enable licensing** — Verify tracks for license certificate generation

---

## How It Works

When you upload a track to BeatPass:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload begins">
    Your audio file is uploaded to BeatPass servers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fingerprint analysis">
    The system analyzes the audio and creates a unique fingerprint based on the sound waves.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Duplicate check">
    The fingerprint is compared against all existing tracks in the BeatPass catalog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification complete">
    If no match is found, your track is verified as unique and ready to save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload Status Indicators

During the fingerprinting process, you'll see these status messages:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Checking** | Starting the duplicate detection process |
| **Analyzing** | Creating and comparing the audio fingerprint |
| **Verified Unique** | No duplicates found — ready to save |
| **Check Failed** | Fingerprinting couldn't complete (you can still proceed) |

---

## Duplicate Detection

If BeatPass detects that your upload matches an existing track, the upload will be blocked. You'll see a dialog showing:

- **Your upload** — The track name and artist you're trying to upload
- **Existing track** — The matching track already in the catalog
- **Similarity score** — How closely the audio matches (shown as a percentage)
- **Fingerprinted date** — When the original was registered

### Why Duplicates Are Blocked

Duplicate detection protects:

- **Original producers** — Prevents others from uploading your work
- **Licensing integrity** — Ensures clear ownership for commercial use
- **Catalog quality** — Avoids redundant copies in the library

## What If a Duplicate Is Detected?

If your upload is blocked as a duplicate:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It's your own track">
    If you previously uploaded this track, check your existing catalog. You may have already uploaded it.
    
    If you need to re-upload (for example, with updated audio), delete the original first, then upload the new version.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="You believe it's an error">
    In rare cases, very similar-sounding tracks might trigger a false positive. If you believe this is an error:
    
    1. Click **Appeal / Contact Support** in the duplicate detection dialog
    2. Or email **contact@beatpass.ca** with:
       - Your account email
       - The track name you're trying to upload
       - The existing track it matched
       - Explanation of why you have rights to upload this content
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Someone uploaded your music">
    If you find that someone has uploaded your original content without permission:
    
    1. Contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca**
    2. Provide proof of ownership (original project files, dated exports, etc.)
    3. The team will investigate and take appropriate action
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After Your Track Is Fingerprinted

Once fingerprinting is complete, you can see the status on your track:

### In the Track Form

The **Audio Fingerprint** section shows:
- **Fingerprinted** status with verification date
- **Duration** of the analyzed audio
- **Hash** — The unique fingerprint identifier (technical reference)

## Replacing Audio on Existing Tracks

If you need to update the audio file on an existing track:

1. Go to your track's edit page
2. In the Audio Fingerprint section, click **Replace Audio File**
3. Upload your new audio file
4. The track will be re-fingerprinted with the new audio

<Note>
  Replacing audio creates a new fingerprint. The old fingerprint is replaced with the new one.
</Note>

---

## Fingerprinting Failures

In rare cases, fingerprinting may fail due to:

- Very short audio clips
- Unusual audio formats
- Server issues during processing

If fingerprinting fails:
- You'll see a **Check Failed** status
- You can still proceed with your upload
- The track may have limited protection features

If you consistently experience fingerprinting failures, contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca**.

## Privacy and Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What data is stored?">
    Only the audio fingerprint (a mathematical representation) is stored — not a copy of your audio. The fingerprint cannot be used to recreate your music.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who can see fingerprint data?">
    Fingerprint hashes are only visible to you (the track owner) and BeatPass administrators for support purposes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can fingerprints be removed?">
    When you delete a track, its fingerprint is also removed from the system.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
