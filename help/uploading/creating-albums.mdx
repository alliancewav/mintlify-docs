Collections (also known as albums) help you organize related beats into cohesive projects. This guide shows you how to create and manage collections on BeatPass.

## Why Create Collections?

Collections offer several benefits for producers:

- **Better Organization** — Group beats by project, style, or theme
- **Improved Discoverability** — Listeners can explore your complete projects
- **Professional Presentation** — Showcase your work as curated releases
- **Easier Navigation** — Fans can browse all tracks in a collection together

## Creating a New Collection

There are two ways to create a collection:

### Method 1: Upload Multiple Tracks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Upload page">
    Navigate to your Producer Dashboard and click **Upload**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Collection mode">
    Toggle to **Collection** mode at the top of the upload page before adding files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your tracks">
    Drag and drop or select multiple audio files. All uploaded tracks will be grouped into the collection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in collection details">
    Add the collection name, artwork, and other information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review each track">
    Make sure each track has correct metadata (name, BPM, key, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Create Collection** to publish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Create Empty Collection First

You can also create a collection and add tracks later:

1. Go to your Producer Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Collections** or **Albums**
3. Click **Create New Collection**
4. Fill in the collection details
5. Add tracks afterward using the edit function

## Collection Information

When creating a collection, you'll fill in:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The title of your collection |
| **Cover Art** | No | Album artwork (square image recommended) |
| **Release Date** | No | When the collection was/will be released |
| **Artists** | Yes | Producer(s) credited on the collection |
| **Genres** | No | Musical styles for categorization |
| **Tags** | No | Searchable keywords |
| **Description** | No | Tell listeners about the project |

<Tip>
  When you upload tracks to a collection, they automatically inherit the collection's artists, genres, and tags. You can customize each track individually if needed.
</Tip>

3. Search for and select the tracks you want to add
4. Save your changes

## Managing Tracks in a Collection

### Removing Tracks

To remove a track from a collection:

## Collection Cover Art

A great cover helps your collection stand out:

- **Recommended size:** 500×500 pixels or larger
- **Format:** Square aspect ratio
- **Quality:** High resolution for best display

If you don't add cover art, BeatPass may use a default image or the artwork from the first track.
