## Managing Tracks in Collections

### Removing Tracks

1. Find the track in the collection's track list
2. Click the remove (X) icon
3. Confirm removal

<Note>
  Removing a track from a collection doesn't delete it. The track continues to exist as an individual track.

2. Drag tracks using the handle icon
3. Drop in the new position
4. Save your changes

## Licensing Restrictions

Some fields become locked after certain actions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="After exclusive sale">
    When a track is sold with exclusive rights:
    - The **exclusive status** is locked to "Sold"
    - Non-exclusive licensing is automatically disabled
    - The track becomes unavailable for other exclusive purchases
    
    You can still edit other metadata like name, description, and tags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Licensing type restrictions">
    If you set a track to "Exclusive Only" and it's purchased:
    - The licensing configuration may be locked
    - This protects the exclusive buyer's rights
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Deleting Content

### Deleting a Track

To permanently delete a track:

1. Go to the track's page or edit page
2. Find the delete option
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a track is permanent. The track and its fingerprint will be removed. If the track was in any collections, it will be removed from them.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Collection

To delete a collection:

1. Navigate to the collection
2. Access edit or management options
3. Choose delete
4. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Deleting a collection removes the album grouping, but individual tracks are not deleted. They become standalone tracks in your catalog.
</Note>
