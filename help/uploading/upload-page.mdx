The upload page is where you publish your beats to BeatPass. This guide walks you through the complete upload process.

---

## Accessing the Upload Page

To access the upload page:

1. Log in to your producer account
2. Go to your **Producer Dashboard**
3. Click **Upload** in the navigation

<Note>
  The upload option is only available to accounts with producer privileges.
</Note>

---

## Upload Modes

BeatPass offers two upload modes:

| Mode | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Beats** | Individual tracks that aren't part of a collection |
| **Collection** | Multiple tracks grouped into an album or beat pack |

Switch between modes using the toggle at the top of the upload page before adding files.

<Warning>
  Once you start uploading files, the mode is locked for that batch. To switch modes, finish or cancel your current uploads first.
</Warning>

## Uploading Files

### Supported Audio Format

BeatPass only accepts **WAV format** audio files for track uploads. This ensures:

- **Maximum audio quality** — No compression artifacts
- **Professional standards** — Industry-standard format for licensing
- **Best listener experience** — Your beats sound exactly as intended

<Warning>
  If you attempt to upload a file with an unsupported format (MP3, FLAC, etc.), you'll see a popup explaining the format requirements and prompting you to upload a WAV file instead.
</Warning>

### Method 1: Drag and Drop

Simply drag your WAV audio files from your computer and drop them onto the upload area.

### Method 2: File Picker

Click the **Upload** button to open your computer's file browser and select WAV files to upload.

You can upload multiple files at once. Each file will appear as a separate track form.

## Processing Status

While your track uploads and processes, you'll see status indicators:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Uploading** | File is being transferred to our servers |
| **Checking** | Verifying the audio file |
| **Analyzing** | Creating audio fingerprint for duplicate detection |
| **Audio ready** | Processing complete, ready to save |

The **Save Track** button remains disabled until all processing is complete.

---

## Audio Fingerprinting

During upload, your track is automatically analyzed for:

- **Duplicate detection** — Ensures the same audio hasn't been uploaded before
- **Content protection** — Creates a unique identifier for licensing

If a duplicate is detected, the upload will be blocked and you'll see details about the existing track. See [Audio Fingerprinting](/help/uploading/audio-fingerprinting) for more information.

## Sample-Safe Status

Before saving, you'll need to indicate the sample clearance status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cleared" icon="shield">
    Your track is 100% original or uses fully cleared samples. Safe for commercial licensing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Needs Clearance" icon="warning">
    Your track contains uncleared samples. Buyers will be notified.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

See [Sample-Safe Warranty](/help/uploading/sample-safe) for details.

## Licensing Options

Configure how your track can be licensed:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Non-Exclusive Only** | Available through subscription downloads only |
| **Exclusive Only** | Only available for exclusive purchase |
| **Both** | Available for both subscription and exclusive purchase |

For exclusive licensing, you can set a price and contact email.

## Saving Your Track

When all required fields are complete and processing is finished:

1. Review all track information
2. Click **Save Track**
3. Your beat is now live on BeatPass!

After saving, you'll see a confirmation and can upload more tracks.
