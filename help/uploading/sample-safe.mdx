The Sample-Safe Warranty helps buyers understand whether your tracks contain samples that require additional clearance. This guide explains how to properly certify your tracks.

---

## What is Sample-Safe?

When artists license beats, they need to know if the beat contains samples from other copyrighted works. Uncleared samples can create legal issues for commercial releases.

The Sample-Safe status tells potential buyers:

- Whether your track is **100% original** or uses **fully cleared samples**
- Or if the track **contains uncleared samples** that require additional clearance

---

## Sample-Safe Statuses

When uploading a track, you'll choose one of two statuses:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cleared" icon="shield">
    **100% original or fully cleared**
    
    Select this if:
    - Your track contains only original sounds you created
    - All samples used are royalty-free
    - You have written clearance for any samples used
    
    Tracks marked as "Cleared" are certified sample-safe and ready for commercial licensing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Needs Clearance" icon="warning">
    **Contains uncleared samples**
    
    Select this if:
    - Your track uses samples from other songs
    - You haven't obtained clearance for the samples
    - The samples are from recognizable copyrighted works
    
    Buyers will be notified that additional clearance may be required.
  </Card>

## Setting Sample-Safe Status

When you upload a track, the Sample-Safe section appears in the track form:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Sample-Safe section">
    Look for the **Sample-Safe™ Warranty** section in your track form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your status">
    Click either **Cleared** or **Needs Clearance** to indicate your track's sample status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add notes (if needed)">
    If you select "Needs Clearance," you can add optional notes about the samples used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your track">
    Your Sample-Safe status is saved with the track.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Counts as a Sample?

A sample is any audio taken from another source and used in your production:

### Common Sample Types

| Type | Examples | Clearance Needed? |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Vocal chops from songs** | Famous lyrics, vocal hooks | Yes, typically |
| **Melody replays from songs** | Interpolations of existing melodies | Often yes |
| **Royalty-free samples** | Sample packs you purchased | Usually no |
| **Your own recordings** | Original vocals, instruments | No |
| **Public domain audio** | Classical recordings (verify!) | Depends |

<Warning>
  Even short samples can require clearance. When in doubt, mark your track as "Needs Clearance" or consult with a music attorney.
</Warning>

## Notes for Uncleared Samples

If you mark a track as "Needs Clearance," you can add notes to help buyers understand:

- What samples are used
- Where they're from
- Clearance status or progress

Example notes:
- "Contains vocal sample from [Artist Name] - clearance in progress"
- "Uses melody inspired by [Song Name] - may require interpolation license"

## How Buyers See Sample Status

When a buyer views your track:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cleared tracks">
    Buyers see that your track is certified sample-safe and ready for commercial use without additional clearance requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tracks needing clearance">
    Buyers are notified that the track contains samples requiring clearance. They can still license the track but understand they may need to clear samples for their release.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Changing Sample-Safe Status

You can update your track's Sample-Safe status at any time:

1. Go to your track's edit page
2. Find the Sample-Safe section
3. Select the new status
4. Save your changes

<Tip>
  If you later obtain clearance for samples in a track, update it from "Needs Clearance" to "Cleared" to make it more attractive to buyers.
</Tip>

## Producer Responsibility

As a producer, you're responsible for:

- **Accurate disclosure** — Honestly indicate whether samples are cleared
- **Knowing your sources** — Understand what audio you've used in your productions
- **Documentation** — Keep records of sample clearances you've obtained

<Note>
  BeatPass relies on producer self-certification. Falsely marking a track as "Cleared" when it contains uncleared samples could result in legal issues for you and your buyers.
</Note>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What about drum sounds and loops from sample packs?">
    Most commercial sample packs come with royalty-free licenses that allow use in productions. These typically don't require additional clearance and can be marked as "Cleared."
    
    Always check the license terms of your sample packs to be sure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I replayed a melody myself. Is that cleared?">
    Replaying a melody (interpolation) from a copyrighted song still requires clearance from the original songwriters. Mark as "Needs Clearance" unless you have written permission.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can buyers request sample information?">
    Buyers interested in your track may reach out to ask about samples. Be prepared to provide information about what you've used.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not sure about clearance?">
    When in doubt, mark your track as "Needs Clearance." It's better to be cautious than to create legal issues for yourself or your buyers.
  </Accordion>
