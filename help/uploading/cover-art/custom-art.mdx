## Tips for Great Cover Art

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use high resolution images">
    Higher resolution images look better on all screen sizes. Aim for at least 1000×1000 pixels for best quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep important elements centered">
    The CD display crops your image into a circle. Keep the main visual elements in the center to ensure they're visible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider the center hole">
    A small circular overlay appears in the center of the CD design. Avoid placing critical details in the very center of your image.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent branding">
    Create a cohesive look across your catalog by using consistent colors, fonts, or design elements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make it stand out">
    Bold colors and clear imagery help your tracks stand out in search results and playlists.
  </Accordion>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Image looks blurry">
    Your source image may be too small. Use images at least 500×500 pixels, ideally 1000×1000 or larger.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Image is cropped unexpectedly">
    The CD display uses a circular crop. Use square images and keep important elements away from the edges.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload fails">
    - Check that your file is under 2 MB
    - Ensure it's a supported format (JPG, PNG, WebP)
