## Where Cover Art Appears

Your track's cover art is displayed in multiple places:

- **Track player** — As a spinning CD design on the track page
- **Search results** — Thumbnail in search listings
- **Your profile** — In your discography and track listings
- **Playlists** — When your track is added to playlists
- **Embed players** — When your music is shared externally
- **Collection pages** — As part of album artwork

## Cover Art Requirements

For the best display quality:

| Requirement | Recommended |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Format** | JPG, PNG, or WebP |
| **Size** | At least 500×500 pixels |
| **Aspect Ratio** | Square (1:1) |
| **Maximum File Size** | 2 MB |

<Tip>
  Use square images for best results. Non-square images will be cropped to fit the circular CD display.
</Tip>

## The CD Design

BeatPass displays cover art in a unique circular CD design:

- Your image fills the disc area
- A center "hole" overlay creates the vinyl look
- The disc spins when a new image is selected or when playing
- This creates a distinctive, music-focused presentation

---

## Cover Art Priority

If no custom artwork is added:

1. **Track cover** — If you've uploaded cover art for the track
2. **Album cover** — If the track belongs to an album with artwork
3. **Default placeholder** — A music note icon is shown

<Note>
  Adding cover art to an album automatically applies to all tracks in that album (unless they have their own artwork).
</Note>
