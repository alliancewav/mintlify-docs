- **Instant artwork** — No design skills needed
- **Genre-matched** — Visuals that fit your music style
- **Professional quality** — AI-generated designs that stand out
- **Free to use** — Included for all producers

## How Matching Works

Presets are matched based on your track's genres:

- The more specific your genres, the more relevant the suggestions
- Multiple genres can combine to find the best matches
- If no exact matches exist, similar genre presets may be shown
- New presets are added regularly to expand coverage

---

## Refreshing Presets

If you don't see presets you like, or if you change your genres:

1. Click the **Refresh** button in the AI Presets section
2. New matching presets will be loaded based on your current genres
3. Previously loaded presets may change

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
