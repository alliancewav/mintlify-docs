BeatPass supports collaborations between producers. When multiple producers work on a track together, each can be credited — and the track appears on every credited producer's profile.

---

## How Collaborations Work

When you upload a track with multiple credited producers:

- The track appears on **each producer's artist profile** under their discography
- **Contribution value is split equally** among all credited producers
- Each collaborator's analytics reflect their share of the track's performance
- The track shows all credited producers on its page

<Info>
  Collaborations are based on who is **credited** on the track — not who physically uploaded it. Only the uploader manages the track, but all credited producers benefit.
</Info>

## Adding Collaborators to a Track

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload or edit your track">
    Go to **Backstage** and upload a new track or edit an existing one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add artist credits">
    In the track metadata, look for the **Artists** or **Credits** field. Search for and add the co-producer(s) by their BeatPass artist name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    Save the track. The collaboration is now live — the track appears on each credited producer's profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The co-producer must have an existing artist profile on BeatPass to be credited. If they don't have one yet, they should [apply to the Producer Program](/help/producer-program/index) first.
</Note>

## How Collaborations Affect Earnings

The track's [contribution value](/help/earnings/contribution-system/index) is divided equally among all credited producers:

| Producers Credited | Each Producer Receives |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 producer | 100% of contribution value |
| 2 producers | 50% each |
| 3 producers | 33.3% each |
| 4 producers | 25% each |

This split applies to **subscription revenue sharing** only. For exclusive license sales, the payout goes to the producer whose Stripe Connect account is linked to the track.

## Collaboration Analytics

### On the Producer Dashboard

Your **Producer Dashboard** includes collaboration-specific insights:

- **Collaboration network** — See which producers you've worked with and how often
- **Collaborative tracks** — View all tracks where you're credited with others
- **Collaboration leaderboard** — Rankings based on collaborative activity across the platform

### On Artist Profiles

Visitors to your artist profile can see your collaborative tracks in a dedicated section, helping them discover the producers you work with.

## Collaboration Recommendations

BeatPass may suggest collaboration opportunities based on:

- Producers in similar genres
- Producers with complementary styles
- Trending collaborations on the platform

These recommendations appear in the **Collaboration** section of your Producer Dashboard.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I remove a collaborator from a track?">
    Yes. Edit the track in **Backstage** and remove the artist from the credits. The track will no longer appear on their profile, and the contribution split will adjust.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does my co-producer need to approve the credit?">
    Currently, the uploader manages credits. There is no approval workflow — so coordinate with your collaborators before publishing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I collaborate with someone who isn't on BeatPass?">
    The co-producer must have a BeatPass artist profile to be credited. Encourage them to join and apply through the [Producer Program](/help/producer-program/index).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do collaborations affect my XP?">
    Yes. You earn XP for the track upload regardless of collaborators, and plays on collaborative tracks contribute to your play-based XP. However, the contribution value (and therefore earnings) is split.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do exclusive sales work for collaborative tracks?">
    Exclusive license payments go to the Stripe Connect account of the track's uploader. Revenue splitting for exclusive sales between collaborators should be arranged privately between the producers.
  </Accordion>
