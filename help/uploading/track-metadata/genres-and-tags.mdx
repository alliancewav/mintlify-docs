<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    "Trap Soul" is more useful than just "Hip Hop." Specific genres attract targeted listeners.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add multiple genres">
    Most beats fit multiple categories. Add 2-3 relevant genres for better discoverability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider crossover appeal">
    If your trap beat has R&B elements, add both genres.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check what's popular">

### How to Add

1. Click in the **Tags** field
2. Type a keyword
3. Press Enter or select from suggestions
4. Repeat to add multiple tags

### Effective Tag Categories

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Mood** | dark, emotional, aggressive, chill, uplifting |
| **Style** | melodic, hard-hitting, bouncy, atmospheric |

### Tag Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Think like a buyer">
    What would an artist type to find a beat like yours? Use those words as tags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be honest">
    Don't add tags that don't describe your beat. Misleading tags frustrate users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use lowercase">
    Tags are case-insensitive, but lowercase keeps things consistent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't duplicate genres">
    If you've added "Trap" as a genre, you don't need it as a tag too.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Genre and AI Cover Art

When you select genres, BeatPass automatically suggests matching AI cover art presets:

1. Add genres to your track
2. The AI Presets section updates with matching artwork
3. Select a preset or upload custom art

More specific genres = better cover art matches.

See [AI Cover Art Presets](/help/uploading/cover-art/templates) for details.
