## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be accurate">
    Enter the correct BPM and key. Inaccurate information frustrates artists looking for specific sounds.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    Use specific genres and tags rather than broad categories. "Trap Soul" is more useful than just "Hip Hop."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be descriptive">
    Write descriptions that capture the vibe, intended use, or inspiration behind your beat.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be consistent">
    Maintain consistent naming and tagging across your catalog for a professional appearance.
