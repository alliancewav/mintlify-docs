BeatPass rewards producers who maintain complete and accurate metadata across their catalog. The more thorough your track information, the higher your metadata accuracy score — and the more achievements you can unlock.

## How Metadata XP Works

Your metadata accuracy is calculated based on how completely you fill out track information across your entire catalog:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload tracks with complete info">
    Fill in all required and optional fields when uploading.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your accuracy score">
    Your score is calculated as a percentage across all tracks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unlock achievements">
    Reach accuracy thresholds to unlock metadata achievements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn XP">
    Each achievement awards XP that contributes to your producer profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>
