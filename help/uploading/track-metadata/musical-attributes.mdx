Musical attributes — BPM, key, and scale — are essential information that helps artists find beats that match their project requirements. These are required fields on BeatPass.

## Why Musical Attributes Matter

Artists often search for beats with specific musical properties:

- **BPM matching** — Artists need tempos that match their vocal flow or project style
- **Key compatibility** — Vocalists want beats in keys that suit their range
- **Scale matching** — Major vs. minor affects the emotional tone

Accurate musical attributes help the right artists find your beats.

## BPM (Beats Per Minute)

BPM indicates the tempo or speed of your beat.

### Requirements
- **Required field** — Must be provided
- **Valid range** — 50 to 200 BPM
- **Whole numbers** — Enter as an integer (e.g., 140, not 140.5)

### Common BPM Ranges by Genre

| Genre | Typical BPM Range |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Trap** | 130-170 |
| **Hip Hop** | 85-115 |
| **R&B** | 60-90 |
| **Drill** | 140-150 |
| **Pop** | 100-130 |
| **Reggaeton** | 90-100 |

### How to Find Your BPM

If you don't know your track's BPM:

1. **Check your DAW** — Most DAWs display the project tempo
2. **Use a tap tempo tool** — Tap along to the beat to calculate BPM
3. **Online BPM analyzers** — Upload your audio to determine tempo

<Tip>
  Always verify the BPM you enter matches your actual track. Incorrect BPM frustrates artists and can hurt your reputation.
</Tip>

## Key

The key indicates the root note or tonal center of your beat.

### Available Keys

| Standard | With Sharps/Flats |
|----------|-------------------|
| C | C# / D♭ |
| D | D# / E♭ |
| E | — |
| F | F# / G♭ |
| G | G# / A♭ |
| A | A# / B♭ |
| B | — |

### How to Determine Key

1. **Check your DAW** — Look at your project settings or piano roll
2. **Listen for the root** — The note that feels like "home" in your melody
3. **Use key detection software** — Tools like Mixed In Key or Keyfinder

## Scale

The scale indicates whether your beat is in a major or minor mode.

### Options

| Scale | Character | Common Uses |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Major** | Bright, happy, uplifting | Pop, upbeat hip hop, dance |
| **Minor** | Dark, moody, emotional | Trap, drill, emotional rap |

### How to Tell Major from Minor

- **Major** — Generally sounds happy, bright, or triumphant
- **Minor** — Generally sounds sad, dark, or intense

Most hip hop and trap beats are in minor keys, while pop and upbeat tracks tend to use major keys.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my beat is in between two keys?">
    Choose the key that best represents the tonal center. If it's ambiguous, go with the key of your main melody or chord progression.

  <Accordion title="Can I use half-time or double-time BPM?">
