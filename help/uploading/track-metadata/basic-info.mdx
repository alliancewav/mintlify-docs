Basic information includes the fundamental details about your track — the name, description, and artist credits. These are the first things listeners see when they discover your music.

---

## Track Name

The track name is the title that appears everywhere on BeatPass.

### Requirements
- **Required field** — You must provide a name before saving
- **Maximum length** — Keep it concise and memorable

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be descriptive but concise">
    **Good:** "Midnight Trap Vibes"
    **Not ideal:** "beat_v2_final_mix_2024"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid generic names">
    Generic names like "Beat 1" or "Untitled" make your tracks harder to remember and find.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider searchability">
    Include descriptive words that artists might search for, like mood, style, or vibe.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Stay consistent">
    If you have a naming convention (like including BPM or key), use it consistently across your catalog.

## Description

The description tells listeners about your beat — the vibe, inspiration, or intended use.

### Guidelines

- **Optional but recommended** — Descriptions help with discoverability
- **Be authentic** — Tell the story behind your beat
- **Include useful info** — Mood, style, recommended artists, or production notes

### What to Include

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Mood/Vibe** | "Dark, atmospheric vibes perfect for late-night sessions" |
| **Style Influences** | "Inspired by Travis Scott and Metro Boomin" |
| **Intended Use** | "Great for melodic rap vocals or R&B hooks" |
| **Production Notes** | "Features live guitar samples and 808 bass" |

### Example Description

> Moody trap beat with haunting melodies and hard-hitting 808s. Perfect for artists looking for that dark, atmospheric sound. Features layered synths and ambient textures. Ideal for emotional rap or alternative hip hop.

## Artists

The artists field credits the producers on the track.

### How It Works

- **Auto-filled** — Your producer name is added automatically when uploading
- **Multiple artists** — Add collaborators by typing and selecting from suggestions
- **Featured artists** — Include featured vocalists or producers

### Adding Collaborators

1. Click in the Artists field
2. Start typing the collaborator's name
3. Select from suggestions if they're on BeatPass
4. Or add a new name if they're not registered

<Note>
  All credited artists should ideally have BeatPass accounts for proper attribution and earnings distribution.
</Note>

## Album (Collection)

Associate your track with an existing collection.

### When to Use

- **Grouped releases** — Tracks that belong to an album, EP, or beat tape
- **Themed collections** — Beats with a common style or project
- **Optional** — Individual tracks don't need to be in a collection

### How to Add

1. Click the Album field
2. Search for your existing collection
3. Select the collection
4. The track will be grouped with other tracks in that collection

Alternatively, upload tracks in Collection mode to create a new album with multiple tracks at once.
