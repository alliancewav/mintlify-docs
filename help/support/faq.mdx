## Licensing & Purchases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between non-exclusive and exclusive?">
    **Non-exclusive**: You get usage rights, but the beat remains available for others to license.
    
    **Exclusive**: You become the sole licensee, and the beat is removed from public sale. No new licenses are issued after an exclusive sale, but any valid non-exclusive licenses granted before the exclusive sale remain in effect for their full terms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to non-exclusive licenses after an exclusive sale?">
    If a track is sold exclusively, any non-exclusive licenses that were already granted **remain valid**. The exclusive sale stops **new** non-exclusive licenses from being issued, but it does not cancel or downgrade licenses you granted earlier.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I pause exclusive availability without unlisting my track?">
    Yes. Producers can set an exclusive offer to **Private/Not available** in Backstage. This keeps the track online (for streaming and any allowed non-exclusive usage) while hiding the exclusive purchase option.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I re-enable standard sales after selling exclusive?">
    No. Once a track has been sold exclusively and marked as **Sold**, BeatPass treats that sale as final. New non-exclusive licenses are not issued after the exclusive sale, though existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
    Digital licenses are generally non-refundable. Exceptions may apply for technical issues or duplicate purchases. See [Policies](/support/policies).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where do I find my license certificate?">
    After purchase, access your licenses in Library > Licenses. Download certificates anytime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade from non-exclusive to exclusive?">
    This depends on the producer. Contact them directly to negotiate an upgrade.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What rights do I get with a license?">
    Standard licenses include rights to use the beat in audio recordings and commercial release. Specific terms are detailed in your license certificate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do coupons apply to exclusive purchases?">
    Today, coupons and promotional discounts on BeatPass apply to subscriptions and certain other flows, **not** to direct track purchases. Exclusive pricing is set by the producer, with a platform fee added on top at checkout.
  </Accordion>

## Earnings & Payouts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get paid?">
    Set up Stripe Connect in Backstage > Finances. Earnings from license sales flow after each successful purchase, and subscription splits are processed after each paid subscription invoice. Stripe then pays out to your bank on its normal payout schedule once you meet minimum thresholds.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the minimum payout?">
    Typically $10 USD, though this may vary by region.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When are payouts processed?">
    Earnings from direct license sales are finalized when payments succeed. Subscription earnings are finalized per subscription invoice when Stripe fires `invoice.paid` and the split job runs; payouts to your Stripe account and then your bank follow your Stripe payout schedule (for example, daily or weekly), not a single monthly batch.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is my contribution value low?">
    Contribution depends on engagement quality (completions, saves) not just play count. See [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay taxes on earnings?">
    Yes, you're responsible for reporting income. BeatPass may issue tax forms based on earnings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analytics & Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often is analytics data updated?">
    Plays update near real-time, contribution hourly, and rankings every 30 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why do my play counts seem low?">
    Only valid plays are counted. Fraud detection removes artificial plays. Very short plays may not register.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's a good completion rate?">
    50-70% is good; above 70% is excellent. Focus on improvement over time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are rankings calculated?">
    Rankings are based on relative performance across multiple metrics including plays, completions, and contribution value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Streaming & Playback

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are there streaming limits?">
    BeatPass does not currently enforce a metered streaming-minute quota. Instead, access is permission-based:
    
    - Free accounts can stream **previews**
    - Subscribers can stream **full tracks**
    - Playback behavior (for example, devices and sessions) may be limited by anti-abuse systems but is not metered in minutes
    
    There is no "minutes left" meter for streaming time; any future streaming quotas would be documented here.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When do streaming limits reset?">
    BeatPass does not currently enforce a monthly streaming-minute quota, so there is nothing to reset. If streaming quotas are introduced in the future, reset behavior will be documented here.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when I hit the limit?">
    BeatPass does not currently meter streaming minutes. If playback stops unexpectedly, it's usually due to:
    - Network or device issues
    - Account changes (for example, subscription expired)
    - Anti-abuse systems (for example, unusual automated activity)
    
    If you repeatedly see playback errors, contact support with the error code shown in the player.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I see remaining minutes in the UI?">
    There is currently no streaming-minute balance or meter in the UI. You can see:
    - Whether you're on the free tier (previews only) or a subscription (full tracks)
    - Your general streaming history and analytics in Backstage (for producers)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What counts as a play?">
    A play is logged when you start listening. Play duration is tracked separately for analytics and contribution calculations. Skipping tracks quickly doesn't count toward your streaming minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does offline playback exist?">
    Currently, BeatPass is streaming-only. Offline playback is not available.
  </Accordion>
