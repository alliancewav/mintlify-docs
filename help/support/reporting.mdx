## False Reports

<Warning>
  Submitting false reports is a violation of our Terms of Service.
</Warning>

| Behavior | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Honest mistake | No penalty |
| Repeated unfounded reports | Warning issued |
| Malicious false reporting | Account suspension |
| Coordinated false reporting | Account termination |

---

## Blocking vs. Reporting

| Action | Effect | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Block** | Prevents them from messaging you or seeing your content | Unwanted contact, personal preference |
| **Report** | Flags for staff review; may result in action | Violations of guidelines |
| **Both** | Block for immediate relief, report for enforcement | Harassment, spam, serious violations |

<Tip>
  You can block and report simultaneously. Blocking doesn't prevent your report from being processed.
</Tip>

---

## Protecting Yourself

### Best Practices

- Don't share personal contact info until trust is established
- Keep business discussions on-platform
- Screenshot suspicious behavior before blocking
- Trust your instincts—if something feels wrong, report it

### If You Feel Unsafe

For immediate safety concerns:

1. Block the user
2. Report with "Safety threat" selected
3. Contact local authorities if threats are credible
4. Email safety@beatpass.ca for urgent escalation
