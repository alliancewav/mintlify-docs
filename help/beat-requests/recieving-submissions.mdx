When you create a beat request, producers can submit tracks from their catalog that match what you're looking for. This guide explains how to receive, review, and respond to submissions.

## How Submissions Work

### The Flow

1. You create a beat request with your specifications
2. Producers browse active requests and find yours
3. They submit tracks from their catalog that match
4. You receive notifications for each submission
5. You review the submissions and connect with producers you like

### What You Receive

Each submission includes:
- **The track itself** — An existing beat from the producer's BeatPass catalog
- **Producer information** — Who submitted it
- **Submission time** — When they sent it

<Note>
  Submissions are existing tracks from producers' catalogs, not custom-made beats. This allows for quick turnaround during the 24-hour request window.
</Note>

## Getting Notified

When a producer submits a beat to your request, you'll be notified based on your settings:

### Notification Channels

| Channel | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **In-app** | Badge in notification center, visible on site |
| **Email** | Email sent to your registered address |
| **Browser push** | Desktop notification if you have them enabled |

### Configuring Notifications

1. Click the **notification icon** (bell) in the top navigation bar
2. Click the **settings icon** (gear) to open **Notification Preferences**
3. Find **Beat Requests** section → **Beat Submissions**
4. Toggle on/off for each channel (Email, Browser, In-App)

<Tip>
  Keep at least one notification channel enabled so you don't miss submissions during your 24-hour window.
</Tip>

## Viewing Submissions

### Where to Find Them

Submissions appear in several places:
- **Your request details** — Shows all submissions to that specific request
- **Notification center** — Alerts for new submissions
- **Request submission count** — Number badge on your active requests

### Submission Information

For each submission, you can see:
- **Track name** — Title of the submitted beat
- **Producer name** — Who made and submitted it
- **Submitted at** — Timestamp of submission
- **Play button** — Listen to the track directly

### Listening to Submissions

Click play on any submission to hear the beat. You can:
- Stream the full track
- Visit the track's page for more details
- Check the producer's profile

## Reviewing Submissions

### Quality Check

When reviewing submissions, consider:
- **Does it match your request?** — Check genre, mood, and BPM
- **Compare to your reference** — Is it similar to what you asked for?
- **Production quality** — Is it well-mixed and professional?
- **Would you use this?** — Can you see yourself recording to it?

### Multiple Submissions

You may receive many submissions to a single request:
- **Review them all** — Different producers have different strengths
- **No limit** — Requests can receive unlimited submissions
- **Take notes** — Keep track of which ones you like

<Info>
  Requests stay open for the full 24 hours regardless of how many submissions you receive. This gives more producers a chance to respond.
</Info>

## Connecting with Producers

### If You Like a Submission

Found a beat you love? Here's what to do:

1. **Visit their profile** — Learn more about the producer
2. **Send a message** — Start a conversation through BeatPass messaging
3. **Discuss next steps** — Talk about licensing, exclusive rights, or collaboration

### Starting a Conversation

To message a producer about their submission:
1. Click on their name or profile
2. Click the **Message** button
3. Introduce yourself and mention the submission
4. Discuss your interest and any questions

### What to Discuss

- Whether the beat is available for licensing
- Exclusive vs. non-exclusive options
- Pricing if budget was mentioned
- Timeline for your project
- Any modifications needed

<Note>
  BeatPass facilitates the connection but doesn't handle payment for custom negotiations. Work out the details directly with the producer.
</Note>

## After the Request Expires

### What Happens at 24 Hours

- **Request closes** — No new submissions can be sent
- **Submissions remain accessible** — You can still view and listen to what was sent
- **No automatic cleanup** — Your submission history stays in your account

### Continuing the Conversation

Even after expiration:
- You can still message producers who submitted
- You can still visit their profiles
- You can still license their submitted tracks through normal means

## Submission Counts

Your request displays a submission count showing how many producers have responded:

| Count | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **0** | No submissions yet |
| **1-5** | Early responses coming in |
| **5-10** | Good level of interest |
| **10+** | High demand for your request |

<Tip>
  If you're not getting submissions, consider whether your specifications are clear and your reference track is accessible.
</Tip>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can producers submit more than one beat?">
    Yes. A producer can submit multiple different tracks to the same request, but each specific track can only be submitted once.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I reject a submission?">
    There's no formal rejection process. Simply don't respond to submissions you're not interested in. Producers understand not every submission will be a match.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if no one submits?">
    If your request doesn't receive submissions, consider:
    - Was your description clear enough?
    - Was your reference track accessible?
    - Was the genre popular on the platform?
    You can create a new request (using another token) with improved details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I see who submitted before listening?">
    Yes. Submissions show the producer's name and avatar before you play the track.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do submissions cost the producer anything?">
    No. Producers can submit to requests for free. They're sharing existing tracks from their catalog.
  </Accordion>
