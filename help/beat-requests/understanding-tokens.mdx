Beat request tokens control how many requests you can create each month. This system ensures fair usage while giving everyone access to the feature.

## How Tokens Work

Think of tokens as credits for creating beat requests:

- **1 to 3 tokens per request** depending on the duration tier you choose (24h = 1, 48h = 2, 72h = 3)
- Tokens refresh at the **end of each month**
- Your plan determines your **<Tooltip tip="The maximum number of tokens your plan provides each month. Unused tokens do not carry over.">monthly allowance</Tooltip>**
- Unused tokens **do not carry over** to the next month

<Info>
  Your token balance resets on the last day of each month, regardless of when you used them.
</Info>

## Token Allowance by Plan

The number of tokens you receive depends on your BeatPass subscription:

| Plan | Monthly Tokens |
|------|----------------|
| **Explorer** (Free) | 1 |
| **Classic** (\$29/mo) | 1 |
| **Plus** (\$45/mo) | 3 |
| **Pro** (\$59/mo) | 5 |

<Note>
  Click your **profile avatar** → **Billing** to view your plan details and token allowance.
</Note>

## Checking Your Token Balance

You can see your current token balance in several places:

1. **Beat Requests Section** — Your balance is displayed prominently
2. **Before Creating a Request** — Shows tokens remaining
3. **After Creating a Request** — Updated balance confirmation

Your token status includes:
- **Current tokens** — How many you have right now
- **Monthly limit** — Your total allowance for the month
- **Used this month** — How many you've already used
- **Reset date** — When your tokens will refresh

---

## Using Tokens

### When Tokens Are Consumed

A token is used when you:
- **Successfully submit** a beat request

### When Tokens Are NOT Used

Tokens are not consumed when you:
- Browse other people's requests
- View submissions to your requests
- Start creating a request but don't submit

---

## Getting Tokens Back (Refunds)

You can get a token refunded by **deleting your request**:

1. Go to your active requests
2. Delete a request you no longer need
3. Your token is **automatically refunded**

<Warning>
  Token refunds only work up to your plan's monthly limit. If you're already at the maximum, deleting a request won't add extra tokens.
</Warning>

### Refund Conditions

| Scenario | Token Refunded? |
|----------|-----------------|
| Delete active request | Yes |
| Delete expired request | No |
| Request expires naturally | No |
| You're at max token limit | No (already at cap) |

<Note>
  When a request is deleted by an admin on your behalf, the refunded token still goes back to **you**, not the admin. Tokens are only refunded to the original request owner and only if your current balance is below your plan's cap.
</Note>

### Staying Under the Cap

- You can never hold more tokens than your plan's monthly allowance (e.g., a 3-token plan will never show 4 tokens)
- Refunds stop once your balance reaches that limit, even if multiple requests are deleted
- If you plan to delete multiple requests, delete and recreate one at a time so each refund has room to land
- Upgrading your plan immediately sets your balance to the new limit; downgrading lowers the cap for future resets

---

## Token Reset Cycle

Tokens reset automatically on a **monthly cycle**:

```
Month starts → Full token balance
              ↓
         Use tokens throughout month
              ↓
Month ends → Balance resets to full
```

### Important Dates

- **Reset happens** — Last day of each month at midnight
- **Days until reset** — Shown in your token status
- **Unused tokens** — Lost at reset (don't carry over)

<Tip>
  If you have unused tokens near the end of the month, consider using them before they reset!
</Tip>

---

## Running Out of Tokens

If your token balance reaches zero:

1. **You cannot create new requests** until tokens reset
2. **Existing requests continue** as normal
3. **You can still receive submissions** on active requests
4. **Options to get more:**
   - Wait for monthly reset
   - Upgrade your plan
   - Delete an existing request (if below cap)

### What You See

When out of tokens, you'll see a message like:
> "You've used all your tokens for this month. Your tokens will reset on [date]."

For free users:
> "You've used all your tokens for this month. Upgrade to get more tokens or wait until next month."

---

## Upgrading for More Tokens

If you need more beat requests than your current plan allows:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Billing**
2. Click **Change plan** to view available options
3. Higher tier plans include more monthly tokens
4. Upgrading **immediately resets** your tokens to the new plan's limit

<Info>
  When you upgrade, your token balance is set to your new plan's monthly limit right away—you don't have to wait for the next month.
</Info>

---

## Token History

BeatPass tracks your token usage history, including:
- When tokens were used (request created)
- When tokens were refunded (request deleted)
- When tokens were reset (monthly or plan change)

This helps you understand your usage patterns over time.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do unused tokens carry over?">
    No. Unused tokens reset at the end of each month. If you have 3 tokens remaining on the last day of the month, they'll reset to your full monthly allowance—not add to it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I downgrade my plan?">
    Your token limit adjusts to match your new plan. If you currently have more tokens than your new plan allows, they remain until you use them, but you won't get more until you're below the new limit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I buy extra tokens?">
    Currently, tokens are only available through your subscription plan. Upgrading your plan is the way to get more monthly tokens.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why wasn't my token refunded when I deleted a request?">
    Tokens are only refunded if you're below your plan's monthly limit. If you're already at the maximum, the system doesn't add extra tokens.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
