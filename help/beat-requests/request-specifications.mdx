When creating a beat request, you can provide detailed specifications to help producers understand exactly what you're looking for. This guide explains each field and how to use it effectively.

---

## Overview of Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Description** | Yes | Explain what you need in your own words |
| **Reference Track** | Yes | Link to a song that represents the sound |
| **Genre** | No | Musical style category |
| **BPM Range** | No | Tempo preference |
| **Key** | No | Musical key preference |
| **Mood** | No | Emotional feel of the beat |
| **Budget** | No | What you're willing to pay |

---

## Description (Required)

The description is where you explain what you're looking for in plain language.

### Requirements

- **Minimum:** 10 characters
- **Maximum:** 500 characters
- No malicious content or links

### What to Include

- Type of song you're making
- Style and vibe you want
- Specific elements (instruments, sounds)
- Artist or song references
- What the beat will be used for

### Example

> Looking for an upbeat R&B/Pop beat with a groovy bassline and smooth synths. Think something like The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" vibe but more laid back. Need it for a summer single about new beginnings.

---

## Reference Track (Required)

A reference track is a link to a song that represents the sound you want. This is the most important specification because it gives producers an audio example.

### Accepted Links

You can use URLs from:
- **YouTube** — youtube.com, youtu.be
- **Spotify** — open.spotify.com
- **SoundCloud** — soundcloud.com
- **Apple Music** — music.apple.com
- **Any public audio URL**

### Requirements

- Must be a valid URL
- Maximum 500 characters
- Must be publicly accessible

### Tips for Choosing References

- **Pick something close** — Don't reference a rock song if you want hip-hop
- **Consider production, not just the artist** — Focus on the beat itself
- **Multiple references in description** — You can mention other songs in your description for additional context

<Warning>
  Links to private or unlisted content won't work. Make sure the reference track is publicly accessible.
</Warning>

---

## Genre (Optional)

The genre field helps categorize your request so producers can quickly identify if it matches their style.

### Format

- Letters, numbers, spaces, dashes, and & symbol
- Maximum 50 characters

### Common Genres

| Main Genre | Subgenres |
|------------|-----------|
| **Hip-Hop** | Trap, Boom Bap, Lo-Fi, Drill |
| **R&B** | Modern R&B, Neo-Soul, Slow Jams |
| **Pop** | Dance Pop, Indie Pop, Synth Pop |
| **Electronic** | House, EDM, Future Bass |
| **Rock** | Alternative, Indie, Pop Rock |
| **Latin** | Reggaeton, Latin Pop, Bachata |
| **Afrobeats** | Afro-Pop, Amapiano |

### Examples

- `Melodic Trap`
- `R&B & Soul`
- `Future Bass`
- `Lo-Fi Hip-Hop`

<Tip>
  Be specific with subgenres. "Drill" is more helpful than just "Hip-Hop" if that's the specific style you want.
</Tip>

---

## BPM Range (Optional)

BPM (beats per minute) indicates the tempo or speed of the beat. Providing a range helps producers understand your pace preference.

### Format

- Numbers and dashes only
- Examples: `140`, `120-140`, `90-100`
- Maximum 20 characters

### Common BPM Ranges by Genre

| Genre | Typical BPM |
|-------|-------------|
| **Trap** | 130-170 |
| **Drill** | 140-150 |
| **Boom Bap** | 85-115 |
| **R&B** | 60-90 |
| **Pop** | 100-130 |
| **House** | 120-130 |
| **Lo-Fi** | 70-90 |
| **Reggaeton** | 85-100 |

### Tips

- **Give a range** — "120-140" is better than a single number
- **Match the genre** — Make sure your BPM fits the style
- **Consider the song** — Faster for energy, slower for emotion

---

## Key (Optional)

The musical key indicates which notes and scales the beat should use. This is especially helpful if you need to match vocals or other elements.

### Format

- Letters, numbers, and # symbol
- Examples: `C`, `F#`, `A Minor`, `Bb Major`
- Maximum 10 characters

### Common Keys in Music Production

| Key | Feel | Common In |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **C Major** | Bright, happy | Pop, Country |
| **A Minor** | Sad, emotional | Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop |
| **G Major** | Uplifting | Rock, Pop |
| **E Minor** | Dark, intense | Hip-Hop, Rock |
| **F Major** | Warm, relaxed | R&B, Jazz |
| **D Minor** | Melancholic | Hip-Hop, Trap |

### When to Specify Key

- You have existing vocals in a specific key
- You're matching another track
- You have a strong preference for the emotional feel

<Note>
  If you're not sure about musical keys, it's okay to leave this blank. Your reference track will give producers enough guidance.
</Note>

---

## Mood (Optional)

The mood describes the emotional feel or atmosphere of the beat you want.

### Format

- Letters and spaces only
- Maximum 50 characters

### Common Moods

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Energetic** | Hype, Aggressive, Upbeat, Energetic |
| **Emotional** | Sad, Emotional, Melancholic, Nostalgic |
| **Relaxed** | Chill, Laid Back, Smooth, Mellow |
| **Dark** | Dark, Eerie, Sinister, Moody |
| **Positive** | Happy, Uplifting, Triumphant, Confident |
| **Romantic** | Sensual, Romantic, Intimate, Dreamy |

### Examples

- `Dark and aggressive`
- `Uplifting`
- `Chill vibes`
- `Emotional but hopeful`

---

## Budget (Optional)

If you're willing to pay for exclusive rights or a custom beat, you can indicate your budget range.

### Format

- Numbers, currency symbols ($, €, £), and dashes
- Examples: `$50-100`, `€200`, `$500+`
- Maximum 50 characters

### Important Notes

- Budget is **optional** and **informational only**
- BeatPass doesn't handle payments for beat requests
- Any transaction happens directly between you and the producer
- Submissions come from producers' existing catalogs

<Info>
  Including a budget can attract more serious submissions, but it's not required. Many producers submit to help discover new artists regardless of budget.
</Info>

## How Specifications Help

The more detail you provide, the better your results:

| Specification Level | Expected Results |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Minimal** (just description + reference) | More submissions, varying relevance |
| **Basic** (+ genre and mood) | Better targeted submissions |
| **Detailed** (all fields) | Highly relevant submissions |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conflicting specifications">
    Don't ask for a "140 BPM chill R&B beat" — 140 BPM is typically too fast for chill R&B. Make sure your specs align.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reference track doesn't match description">
    If your reference is a trap song but you describe wanting R&B, producers won't know what you actually want.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too vague">
    "Good beat" or "fire instrumental" doesn't help. Be specific about style, mood, and elements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too restrictive">
    Requiring exactly "132 BPM in F# Minor with specific synths" may limit submissions. Give some flexibility.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
