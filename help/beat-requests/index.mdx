Beat Requests let you describe the type of beat you're looking for and receive submissions from producers on BeatPass. It's a direct way to connect with talented creators and find music tailored to your specific needs.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Request">
    Describe the beat you're looking for, including genre, tempo, mood, and a reference track. This costs one token from your monthly allowance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Producers See Your Request">
    Verified producers on BeatPass are notified when new requests are posted. They can browse all active requests and decide if they want to submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Submissions">
    Producers submit beats from their catalog that match your requirements. You'll be notified each time someone sends you a beat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Connect">
    Listen to the submissions and connect with producers whose work you like. Requests stay active for 24 hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who Can Use Beat Requests?

### As a Requester (Anyone)

Any BeatPass user can create beat requests:
- **Free users** — Receive tokens based on your plan
- **Subscribers** — Higher monthly token allowance

### As a Producer

To submit beats to requests, you need:
- A **producer profile** on BeatPass
- At least one **uploaded track** to submit

<Info>
  All producers can enable notifications for new beat requests in their notification settings.
</Info>

## The Token System

Beat requests use a **token system** to ensure fair usage:

- Each request costs **1 token**
- Tokens reset at the **end of each month**
- Your plan determines your monthly token allowance
- Deleting a request **refunds** your token

<Tip>
  Check your token balance before creating a request. You can see your remaining tokens in the beat request section.
</Tip>

For full details, see [Understanding Tokens](/help/beat-requests/understanding-tokens).

## Request Lifecycle

```
Created → Active (24 hours) → Expired
              ↓
        Submissions arrive
```

1. **Created** — Your request is posted and visible to producers
2. **Active** — Producers can submit beats for 24 hours
3. **Expired** — Request closes automatically, no new submissions accepted

<Note>
  Requests don't close when you receive submissions. They stay open for the full 24 hours so multiple producers can respond.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### For Requesters

- **Be specific** — The more detail you provide, the better matches you'll receive
- **Include a reference track** — This helps producers understand your vision
- **Check regularly** — Review submissions as they come in
- **Respond to producers** — If you like a submission, reach out via messaging

### For Producers

- **Read carefully** — Make sure your beat actually matches what's requested
- **Submit your best work** — Quality submissions lead to connections
- **Be timely** — Requests expire after 24 hours
