Beat Requests let you describe the type of beat you're looking for and receive submissions from producers on BeatPass. It's a direct way to connect with talented creators and find music tailored to your specific needs.

<Tooltip tip="Credits that control how many beat requests you can create each month. Your plan determines your allowance." cta="Learn more" href="/help/beat-requests/understanding-tokens">Tokens</Tooltip> are used to create requests, and each request's cost depends on the <Tooltip tip="The active window you choose for a request: 24h (1 token), 48h (2 tokens), or 72h (3 tokens).">duration tier</Tooltip> you select.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Request">
    Describe the beat you're looking for, including genre, tempo, mood, and a reference track. Choose a duration tier (24, 48, or 72 hours) — each tier costs 1, 2, or 3 tokens respectively.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Producers See Your Request">
    Verified producers on BeatPass are automatically notified when new requests are posted. Other producers can browse the public feed and decide if they want to submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Submissions">
    Producers submit beats from their catalog that match your requirements. You'll be notified each time someone sends you a beat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Connect">
    Listen to the submissions and connect with producers whose work you like. Requests stay active for the duration you selected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who Can Use Beat Requests?

### As a Requester (Anyone)

Any BeatPass user can create beat requests:
- **Free users** — Receive tokens based on your plan
- **Subscribers** — Higher monthly token allowance

### As a Producer

To submit beats to requests, you need:
- A **producer profile** on BeatPass
- At least one **uploaded track** to submit

<Info>
  All producers can enable notifications for new beat requests in their notification settings.
</Info>

---

## The Token System

Beat requests use a **token system** to ensure fair usage:

- Each request costs **1, 2, or 3 tokens** depending on the duration tier you choose
- Tokens reset at the **end of each month**
- Your plan determines your monthly token allowance
- Deleting a request **refunds** your token

<Tip>
  Check your token balance before creating a request. You can see your remaining tokens in the beat request section.
</Tip>

For full details, see [Understanding Tokens](/help/beat-requests/understanding-tokens).

## Request Lifecycle

```
Created → Active (24 / 48 / 72 hours) → Expired
                 ↓
           Submissions arrive
```

1. **Created** — Your request is posted and visible to producers
2. **Active** — Producers can submit beats for the duration you selected (24, 48, or 72 hours)
3. **Expired** — Request closes automatically, no new submissions accepted

<Note>
  Requests don't close when you receive submissions. They stay open for the full selected duration so multiple producers can respond.
</Note>

---

## Best Practices

### For Requesters

- **Be specific** — The more detail you provide, the better matches you'll receive
- **Include a reference track** — This helps producers understand your vision
- **Check regularly** — Review submissions as they come in
- **Respond to producers** — If you like a submission, reach out via messaging

### For Producers

- **Read carefully** — Make sure your beat actually matches what's requested
- **Submit your best work** — Quality submissions lead to connections
- **Be timely** — Requests expire after 24, 48, or 72 hours depending on the tier selected
