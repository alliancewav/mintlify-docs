Creating a beat request is the first step to finding producers who can deliver exactly what you're looking for. This guide walks you through the process from start to finish.

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- **At least 1 token available** — Check your token balance in the beat requests section
- **A reference track URL** — This is required and helps producers understand your vision
- **A clear description** — Know what style, mood, and vibe you're looking for

<Warning>
  Creating a request consumes tokens based on the duration you choose (1 for 24 hours, 2 for 48 hours, 3 for 72 hours). Make sure you're ready to post before starting.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Open Beat Requests

Navigate to the Beat Requests section from the main menu or your dashboard.

### Step 2: Click "Create Request"

Look for the button to create a new request. You'll see your current token balance displayed.

### Step 3: Write Your Description

Describe the beat you're looking for in detail. You have up to **500 characters** to explain:
- What type of song you're creating
- The sound or style you want
- Any specific elements you need
- What you'll use it for

<Tip>
  Be as specific as possible. Instead of "I need a trap beat," try "Looking for a dark trap beat with heavy 808s, similar to Metro Boomin style, for an aggressive rap verse."
</Tip>

### Step 4: Add Specifications (Optional but Recommended)

Fill in the optional fields to help producers match your needs:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Genre** | Music style | Hip-Hop, R&B, Pop, Trap |
| **BPM Range** | Tempo range | 120-140 |
| **Key** | Musical key | C Minor, F#, A Major |
| **Mood** | Emotional feel | Dark, Uplifting, Chill |
| **Budget** | Payment range (optional) | $50-100 |

### Step 5: Add Reference Track (Required)

Paste a URL to a song that represents the sound you want. This can be:
- A YouTube link
- A Spotify link
- A SoundCloud link
- Any publicly accessible audio URL

<Note>
  The reference track is required. Producers rely on this to understand exactly what sound you're after.
</Note>

### Step 6: Choose Duration & Submit

Select how long you want the request to stay active:

| Duration | Token Cost | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **24 hours** | 1 token | Standard visibility |
| **48 hours** | 2 tokens | Need more time for responses |
| **72 hours** | 3 tokens | Maximum exposure |

Review everything and click **Submit**. Your request will:
- Consume tokens based on the duration you selected
- Go live immediately
- Stay active for **24 / 48 / 72 hours**
- Trigger automatic notifications to verified producers (other producers can still browse the feed manually)

## Writing an Effective Description

Your description is the most important part of your request. Here's how to write one that attracts the right producers:

### Do Include

- **Specific genre and subgenre** — "Melodic trap" is better than just "trap"
- **Mood and energy level** — "High energy, aggressive" or "Laid back, smooth"
- **Instrumentation preferences** — "Heavy 808s," "Live guitar," "Synth-heavy"
- **Artist references** — "Similar to Drake's recent style" or "Metro Boomin vibes"
- **Purpose** — "For a club track" or "For a personal project"

### Avoid

- **Being too vague** — "I need a good beat" doesn't help producers
- **Conflicting requirements** — "Fast and slow" or "Happy but sad"
- **Unrealistic expectations** — Be reasonable with your requests

### Example Descriptions

**Good Example:**
> Looking for a melodic trap beat with emotional piano melodies and hard-hitting 808s. Think Lil Baby or Gunna style. Need something around 140 BPM in a minor key. This is for a personal project about overcoming struggles.

**Poor Example:**
> Need a fire beat ASAP, something that slaps. Make it good.

2. **Producers Notified** — Verified producers receive a notification (others can see it in the feed)
3. **Timer Starts** — Your 24 / 48 / 72-hour window begins
4. **Submissions Arrive** — Producers start sending beats that match your request
5. **You Get Notified** — Each submission triggers a notification to you

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit my request after posting?">
    No, requests cannot be edited once submitted. If you made a mistake, you can delete the request (which refunds your token) and create a new one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have any tokens?">
    You'll need to wait until your tokens reset at the end of the month, or upgrade your plan for more tokens.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create multiple requests at once?">
    Yes, as long as you have enough tokens. Each request costs 1 token.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is a reference track required?">
    Reference tracks help producers understand exactly what sound you're looking for. Without one, you're likely to receive submissions that don't match your vision.
