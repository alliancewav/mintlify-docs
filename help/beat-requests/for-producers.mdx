Beat requests are an opportunity to connect with artists looking for specific sounds. As a producer, you can browse active requests and submit tracks from your catalog that match what requesters need.

---

## Who Can Submit to Requests

To submit beats to requests, you need:

- **A producer profile** — You must have an artist profile on BeatPass
- **Uploaded tracks** — At least one track in your catalog to submit
- **Upload permission** — Your account needs the ability to upload music (the same permission required to add tracks to your catalog)

Any user with a producer profile can submit beats to requests. Both verified and non-verified producers have the same submission capabilities.

<Info>
  Producers can enable notifications for new beat requests in their notification settings, helping you respond quickly to opportunities.

## Finding Beat Requests

### Browsing Active Requests

Navigate to the Beat Requests section to see all currently active requests. Each request shows:

- **Requester name and avatar** — Who's looking for a beat
- **Description** — What they're looking for
- **Specifications** — Genre, BPM, key, mood (if provided)
- **Reference track** — A link to their sound reference
- **Time remaining** — How long until the request expires
- **Submission count** — How many producers have already submitted

### Filtering Requests

Look for requests that match your style:
- Check the **genre** field for your specialty
- Review the **reference track** to understand the sound
- Read the **description** carefully for specific requirements

<Tip>
  Focus on requests where your existing catalog has a good match. Quality over quantity leads to better connections.
</Tip>

## Submitting a Beat

### Step-by-Step

1. **Find a matching request** — Browse and find one that fits your style
2. **Listen to the reference track** — Make sure you understand what they want
3. **Choose your track** — Select a track from your catalog that matches
   - You must own the track or be listed as a collaborator on it
4. **Click Submit/Send Beat** — Confirm your submission

### What Gets Submitted

When you submit:
- The requester receives your **existing track** from your BeatPass catalog
- You can submit **multiple different tracks** to the same request
- Each unique track can only be submitted **once per request**

### Restrictions

| Action | Allowed? |
|--------|----------|
| Submit your own track | ✓ |
| Submit a collaboration track | ✓ |
| Submit to your own request | ✗ |
| Submit the same track twice to one request | ✗ |
| Submit multiple different tracks | ✓ |

<Warning>
  You cannot submit beats to your own requests. The system prevents self-fulfillment.
</Warning>

## After You Submit

### What Happens

1. **Requester is notified** — They receive a notification about your submission
2. **Track appears in their submissions** — They can play and review your beat
3. **Request stays open** — Others can still submit (requests don't close early)
4. **Requester may reach out** — If they like your beat, they might message you

### Success Messages

After a successful submission:
> "Beat sent successfully! You can submit more tracks to this request if you'd like."

### Error Messages

If something goes wrong:
- **"You have already submitted this track to this request"** — You can't submit the same track twice; pick a different track
- **"Beat request has expired"** — The 24 / 48 / 72-hour window has closed
- **"You can only send tracks that you own or collaborate on"** — Track ownership issue
- **"You do not have permission to send beats"** — Your account is missing upload permissions

## Best Practices

### Choosing What to Submit

- **Match the request** — Don't submit trap when they want R&B
- **Check the reference** — Your beat should sound similar to their example
- **Consider the mood** — An aggressive beat won't work for a chill request
- **Quality matters** — Submit your best work, not just any track

### Building Connections

Beat requests are about more than just submissions:
- **Read requests carefully** — Show you understand what they need
- **Follow up** — If they engage with your submission, be responsive
- **Build relationships** — A good match can lead to ongoing collaborations

### Timing

- **Requests expire after 24 hours** — Don't wait too long
- **Early submissions get more attention** — Requesters often check as submissions arrive
- **Check regularly** — New requests are posted throughout the day

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to create new beats for requests?">
    No. You submit existing tracks from your BeatPass catalog. Beat requests are for connecting artists with your existing work, not custom commissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if they want to buy exclusive rights?">
    If the requester includes a budget and wants exclusive rights, that negotiation happens directly between you and them via messaging. BeatPass doesn't process these payments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I withdraw a submission?">
    Currently, submissions cannot be withdrawn once sent. Make sure you're happy with your selection before submitting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why can't I submit to a request?">
    Common reasons:
    - The request has expired (24-hour limit passed)
    - You already submitted that specific track
    - It's your own request
    - You don't have any tracks in your catalog
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I become verified?">
    Verification is available to producers who meet certain criteria. Check your Backstage settings or contact support for verification requirements.
  </Accordion>
