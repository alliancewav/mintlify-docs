# User Profiles

Your user profile is your home on BeatPass. It's where other members can learn about you, see what beats you're into, and connect with you.

## What's on Your Profile

When someone visits your profile, they'll see:

- **Your avatar** — A profile picture that represents you
- **Your name** — How you appear across BeatPass
- **Profile tabs** — Different sections showing your activity and collections

### Profile Header

At the top of your profile, visitors can:

- **Follow you** — Click the **Follow** button to get updates on your activity
- **Message you** — Click the **Message** button to start a conversation
- **See your avatar** — Your profile picture displays prominently

If it's your own profile, you'll see an **Edit** button instead, which opens the profile editor.

## Profile Tabs

Your profile has several tabs that display different types of content:

| Tab | What It Shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Liked Beats** | All the beats you've liked |
| **Public Playlists** | Playlists you've created and made public |
| **Reposts** | Content you've shared with your followers |
| **Liked Collections** | Albums you've liked |
| **Liked Producers** | Producers you follow or have liked |
| **Followers** | People who follow you |
| **Following** | People and producers you follow |

<Tip>
Your liked beats and playlists are a great way to share your taste with others. Many producers check out who's liking their beats, so keeping an active profile can help you connect with artists you admire.
