# Profile Visibility

Your BeatPass profile is designed to be a public space where others can discover you and your musical tastes. Here's what you need to know about profile visibility and privacy.

## What's Always Visible

When someone visits your profile, they can see:

- **Your avatar and display name**
- **Your bio and description**
- **Your location** (if you've added one)
- **Your social links**
- **Your followers and following lists**
- **Beats you've liked**
- **Collections you've liked**
- **Producers you've liked**
- **Content you've reposted**

This public visibility helps you connect with the community and lets producers see who's enjoying their music.

## Controlling Playlist Visibility

The main privacy control you have is over your **playlists**. Each playlist can be set to either public or private.

### Making a Playlist Private

When creating or editing a playlist:

1. Open the playlist editor
2. Find the **Public** toggle switch
3. Turn it **off** to make the playlist private

### What Private Playlists Mean

- **Private playlists** only appear in your Library—not on your public profile
- **Public playlists** appear on your profile's **Public Playlists** tab for everyone to see

<Tip>
Use private playlists for personal collections you want to keep to yourself. Make playlists public when you want to share your curated selections with others.
</Tip>

## What Others Can Do on Your Profile

Visitors to your profile can:

- **Follow you** — They'll see your activity in their feed
- **Message you** — Send you a direct message
- **Browse your content** — View your liked beats, public playlists, and more

## Messaging Privacy

You can receive messages from any logged-in BeatPass user. Currently, there's no option to disable incoming messages.

If you receive unwanted messages, you can:
- Block specific users
- Report inappropriate behavior to our support team

## Account Visibility

Your BeatPass account and profile are visible to:

- **Anyone on BeatPass** — Logged-in users can find and view your profile
- **Search results** — Your profile may appear when people search for usernames

<Note>
BeatPass is a community platform, so profiles are designed to be discoverable. This helps connect listeners with producers and build a vibrant music community.
