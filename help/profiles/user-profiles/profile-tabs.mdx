# Profile Tabs

Your BeatPass profile is organized into tabs, each showing different aspects of your activity and collections. Here's what each tab contains and how to make the most of them.

## Available Tabs

### Liked Beats

The **Liked Beats** tab shows all the beats you've liked on BeatPass. When you click the heart icon on any beat, it gets saved here.

- Beats are displayed in a list format
- You can play any beat directly from this tab
- Great for finding beats you've saved to revisit later

<Tip>
Use likes to bookmark beats you want to come back to. It's also a way to show appreciation to producers—they get notified when you like their work.
</Tip>

### Public Playlists

The **Public Playlists** tab displays playlists you've created and chosen to make public.

- Each playlist shows its cover art and name
- Click any playlist to view its contents
- Private playlists don't appear here

To create a new playlist or manage existing ones, visit your Library.

### Reposts

The **Reposts** tab shows content you've shared with your followers.

When you repost a beat or playlist:
- It appears on this tab
- Your followers see it in their feed
- It helps the original creator get more exposure

Reposting is a great way to share your favorite finds with your network.

### Liked Collections

The **Liked Collections** tab displays albums and beat packs you've liked.

- Shows the cover art and title of each collection
- Click to explore the full album
- Helps you keep track of projects you enjoy

### Liked Producers

The **Liked Producers** tab shows producers you've liked or shown interest in.

- Displays producer avatars and names
- Click to visit their producer profile
- A quick way to rediscover artists you've connected with

### Followers

The **Followers** tab shows everyone who follows you on BeatPass.

- See who's interested in your activity
- Click any follower to visit their profile
- Follow them back if you'd like

If you don't have any followers yet, this tab will be empty. As you engage with the community, you'll naturally attract followers.

### Following

The **Following** tab shows everyone you follow.

- Includes both users and producers
- Click to visit their profiles
- Manage your network by unfollowing from their profiles

## Navigating Between Tabs

Tabs appear as pill-shaped buttons at the top of your profile content area. Simply click any tab to switch to that section.

On mobile devices, you may need to scroll horizontally to see all available tabs.

## Empty Tabs

If a tab is empty, you'll see a friendly message encouraging you to take action:

- **No liked beats?** Start exploring and liking beats you enjoy
- **No playlists?** Create your first playlist from your Library
- **No followers?** Engage with the community to attract followers

## Profile Visibility

All content shown in your profile tabs is visible to anyone who visits your profile. This includes:

- Beats you've liked
- Playlists you've made public
- Content you've reposted
- Your follower and following lists

<Note>
Private playlists are never shown on your profile. Only you can see them in your Library.
