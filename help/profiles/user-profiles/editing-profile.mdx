### Your Links

Add links to your social profiles and websites so visitors can find you elsewhere:

- Instagram
- Twitter / X
- YouTube

Links appear on your profile with recognizable icons, making it easy for visitors to connect with you on other platforms.

## Saving Your Changes

After making your edits:

1. Review your changes in the editor
2. Click **Save** to apply your updates
3. The dialog will close and your profile will be updated immediately

If you change your mind, click **Cancel** to discard your changes.

## Profile Picture Tips

For the best results with your avatar:

- **Use a square image** — Your photo will be displayed in a circle
- **Keep it clear** — Choose an image where your face or logo is easily visible
- **Stay professional** — Your avatar appears across BeatPass in comments, messages, and more

<Warning>
Your profile picture is visible to everyone on BeatPass. Make sure it follows our community guidelines and doesn't contain inappropriate content.
</Warning>

## Editing From Account Settings

You can also edit some profile details from your account settings:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. This takes you to Account Settings where you can update your account information

The profile editor dialog (accessed from your profile page) is the quickest way to update your public-facing profile.
