# Your Profile on BeatPass

BeatPass offers two types of profiles to serve different purposes: **User Profiles** for listeners and beat collectors, and **Producer Profiles** for beat makers who want to showcase and sell their music.

## Profile Types

## Which Profile Do I Have?

When you create a BeatPass account, you automatically get a **User Profile**. This lets you:

- Follow your favorite producers
- Like and save beats
- Create and share playlists
- Message other users
- See who follows you

If you're a beat maker and want to upload and sell your music, you can apply for a **Producer Profile** through the Producer Program. Once approved, you'll have access to powerful tools for managing your catalog, tracking your analytics, and earning from your beats.
