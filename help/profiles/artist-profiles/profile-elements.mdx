# Profile Elements

Your producer profile has several visual and informational elements that help define your brand. Here's how to set up each one for maximum impact.

## Cover Image

Your cover image is the large banner that appears at the top of your profile. It's the first thing visitors see, so make it count.

### Recommended Specifications

- **Size**: 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP
- **Max file size**: 2MB

  <Step title="Open the Edit Menu">
    Click the **More** button on your profile, then select **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Cover Image Section">
    At the top of the editor, you'll see the cover image upload area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Image">

<Tip>
Use a high-quality image that represents your brand. Studio shots, artwork, or professional photos work great. Avoid busy images that might clash with your profile text.

## Artist Avatar

Your avatar is your profile picture—it appears on your profile, next to your beats, and throughout BeatPass.

### Recommended Specifications

- **Shape**: Square (displays as a circle)
- **Minimum size**: 400x400 pixels
- **Format**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP
- **Max file size**: 2MB

### Setting Your Avatar

To change your avatar, go to your artist profile, click **More** → **Edit**, then find the **Artist Avatar** section on the left side. Click to upload a new image. The editor includes a cropping tool to help you get the perfect circular crop.

<Tip>
Your avatar should be recognizable even at small sizes. A clear headshot or logo works best.
</Tip>

## Location

Adding your location helps listeners find local producers and adds authenticity to your profile.

### What You Can Add

- **Country** — Select from a dropdown list
- **City** — Enter your city name

Your location appears in the About section of your profile with a flag icon representing your country.

### Setting Your Location

1. Go to your artist profile and click **More** → **Edit**
2. In the editor, go to the **Biography** tab
3. Select your **Country** from the dropdown
4. Enter your **City**
5. Click **Save Artist** to save your changes

## Genres

Genres help categorize your music and make you discoverable when listeners search for specific styles.

### Adding Genres

1. In the artist editor, go to the **Details** tab
2. Find the **Genres** field
3. Start typing a genre name and select from suggestions
4. Add multiple genres to accurately represent your style

You can add as many genres as apply to your music. Genres appear on your profile in the About section.

### Genre Tips

- **Be accurate** — Only add genres that truly represent your sound
- **Be specific** — "Trap" is more helpful than just "Hip Hop" if that's your focus
- **Stay current** — Update genres as your style evolves

## Putting It All Together

A complete producer profile includes:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Cover image** | Brand your page and make a strong first impression |
| **Avatar** | Be recognizable across the platform |
| **Location** | Connect with local fans and show your roots |
| **Genres** | Help the right listeners find your music |

<Note>
All these elements are editable at any time from your artist editor. Keep your profile fresh by updating images and information as your brand evolves.
