# Discography & Profile Tabs

Your producer profile organizes your content into tabs, making it easy for visitors to browse your catalog. Here's what each tab shows and how to make the most of them.

## Available Tabs

### Discography

The **Discography** tab is your main showcase. It displays your music catalog in an organized format, featuring:

- **Your pinned track** (if you have one) — Highlighted at the top
- **Top tracks** — Your most popular beats
- **Recent releases** — Your latest uploads

This tab gives visitors a curated overview of your best and newest work.

### Beats

The **Beats** tab shows all your individual tracks with powerful filtering options:

- **Search** — Find specific beats by name
- **Genre filter** — Filter by musical style
- **Sort order** — Switch between newest first or oldest first
- **Collaboration filter** — Show all tracks, collaborative only, or solo only

This is where visitors can dive deep into your full catalog.

<Tip>
The Beats tab is especially useful for visitors looking for a specific style or sound. Make sure your beats are properly tagged with genres to help them get discovered.

### Albums

The **Albums** tab displays your beat collections and projects:

- Album artwork and titles
- Click any album to see all its tracks
- Great for showcasing themed beat packs or curated collections

If you haven't released any albums yet, this tab will show a message encouraging visitors to follow you for future releases.

### Gallery

The **Gallery** tab is your photo collection. It displays images you've uploaded to show off:

- Your personality
- Your studio setup
- Behind-the-scenes moments
- Performances or events
- Artwork and visuals

Photos display in a grid layout. Visitors can click any image to view it larger.

If you haven't added any photos yet, visitors won't see the Gallery tab. To add photos, go to your artist profile, click **More** → **Edit**, then use the **Images** tab.
