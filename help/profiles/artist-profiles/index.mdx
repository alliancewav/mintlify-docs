# Producer Profiles

Your producer profile is your professional storefront on BeatPass. It's where listeners discover your music, learn about you, and license your beats. A well-crafted producer profile helps you stand out and build your audience.

## What Makes Producer Profiles Different

Unlike regular user profiles, producer profiles are built for showcasing your music:

- **Discography display** — Your beats and albums front and center
- **Cover image** — A wide header image to brand your page
- **Photo gallery** — Share images of yourself, your studio, and your work
- **About section** — Tell your story with a detailed bio
- **Verified badge eligibility** — Stand out as a verified producer
- **Pinned track** — Feature your best beat at the top
- **Achievement badges** — Show off milestones you've earned

## Profile Sections

Your producer profile includes these tabs:

| Tab | What It Shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Discography** | Your complete catalog organized by release |
| **Beats** | All your individual tracks with filtering options |
| **Albums** | Beat collections and projects you've released |
| **Credits** | Your work on other artists' projects from Spotify |
| **Gallery** | Photos you've uploaded to your profile |
| **Followers** | People following your music |
| **Similar Producers** | Other producers with similar styles |
| **Achievements** | Badges and milestones you've earned |

## Profile Header

At the top of your producer profile, visitors see:

- **Your cover image** — A wide banner image (recommended 1920x1080)
- **Your avatar** — Your profile picture displayed prominently
- **Your producer name** — Large and visible
- **Verified badge** — If you're verified, a blue checkmark appears next to your name
- **Action buttons** — Follow, Like, and Message buttons for visitors
