# Professional Credits

Professional Credits let you showcase songs and albums you've worked on from Spotify directly on your BeatPass producer profile. Whether you've produced, mixed, mastered, or contributed to other artists' projects, credits help establish your credibility and build your professional portfolio.

## What Are Credits?

Credits are a way to highlight your production work beyond the beats you sell on BeatPass. They link to real releases on Spotify, giving visitors proof of your professional experience.

**Credits can showcase your role as:**

| Role Category   | Example Roles                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | Producer, Co-Producer, Beat Maker                       |
| **Engineering** | Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer, Recording Engineer |
| **Writing**     | Songwriter, Composer, Arranger                          |
| **Performance** | Featured Artist, Vocalist, Musician                     |
| **Other**       | Executive Producer, A&R, Creative Director              |

<Info>
  Credits appear in the **Credits** tab on your producer profile. Visitors can filter by role to see specific contributions.

## Adding Your First Credit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Artist Edit Page">
    Navigate to your producer profile and click **Edit**, or access your artist settings through the admin panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Credits Tab">
    In the artist editor, you'll see tabs for **Details**, **Links**, **Biography**, **Images**, and **Credits**. Click the **Credits** tab to access your credits management.

    <Info>
      The Credits tab only appears for existing artist profiles. If you're creating a new artist, save it first, then return to add credits.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Credit">
    You'll see a "Your Credits" section with a description and an **Add Credit** button. Click it to open the credit search dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search Spotify">
    At the top of the dialog, toggle between **Songs** and **Albums** to select what you're searching for. Type the song or album name in the search field—results appear as you type.

    <Tip>
      Results show the cover art, title, artist, release year, and type. If you've already added roles for an item, you'll see a badge indicating how many roles are added.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Roles">
    After selecting a song, you'll see the "Select Your Roles" screen. Roles are organized by category (Production, Engineering, Writing, Performance, Other). Click any role to select it—selected roles turn highlighted.

    You can select **multiple roles** for each credit. For example, if you both produced and mixed a track, select both "Producer" and "Mixing Engineer." Roles you've already added appear crossed out and disabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and Add">
    Click **Add X Credits** (where X is the number of roles selected) to save. The credit will now appear in your credits list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding an Entire Album

When you add an album as a credit, you can customize your role for each individual track. This is perfect when you've worked on multiple songs from the same project with different contributions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for the Album">
    In the Add Credit dialog, click the **Albums** toggle at the top, then search for the project name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Album">
    Click on the album from the search results. The search result shows the album cover, name, artist, track count, and release year. You'll be taken to the "Configure Album Credits" screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Roles to All Tracks">
    At the top, you'll see the **Apply roles to all tracks** section with common role buttons. Select the roles that apply to most tracks, then click **Apply to All Tracks** to set those roles on every track in the album.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Individual Tracks (Optional)">
    Below the bulk section, you'll see "Or customize per track" with a list of all album tracks. Each track shows its number, name, and any assigned roles as small badges.

    Click any track row to expand it and reveal role buttons. Toggle individual roles on or off for that specific track.

    <Info>
      Tracks with no roles selected will not be added as credits. This lets you skip tracks where you didn't contribute.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Album Credits">
    Click **Add Album Credits** to save all configured track credits at once. Only tracks with at least one role assigned will be added.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Credit Types

### Songs vs Albums

Credits are displayed differently based on type:

| Type      | Display                          | Best For                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Song**  | Individual card with cover art   | One-off features, single productions         |
| **Album** | Stacked card showing track count | Projects where you worked on multiple tracks |

### Multiple Roles

You can have **multiple roles on the same song**. Each role creates a separate credit entry, but they're grouped together visually:

- A song where you were Producer + Mixing Engineer shows both role badges
- Filter pills let visitors see all your work in a specific role

---

## Managing Your Credits

### Viewing Credits in the Editor

In your artist edit page under the **Credits** tab, your credits are displayed as cards with:

- **Cover art** from Spotify
- **Song/Album name** and artist name
- **Role badges** showing your contributions (e.g., "producer", "mixing engineer")
- **Track count** for albums with multiple credited tracks
- **Action buttons** for adding roles, opening in Spotify, deleting, or expanding (for albums)

Album credits that span multiple tracks display with a **stacked card effect** to visually indicate they contain multiple tracks.

### Adding More Roles to an Existing Credit

To add additional roles to a credit you've already added:

1. Go to your artist edit page → **Credits** tab
2. Find the credit card
3. Click the **\+** (plus) button on the right side of the card
4. A dialog appears showing available roles—select the ones you want to add
5. Click **Add Roles** to save

<Tip>
  Roles you've already added to that credit will appear disabled, so you can't accidentally add duplicates.
</Tip>

### Removing a Credit

To remove a credit and all its associated roles:

1. Go to your artist edit page → **Credits** tab
2. Find the credit you want to remove
3. Click the red **trash icon** button on the right side of the card
4. A confirmation dialog appears asking "Remove '[name]' and all its roles from your credits?"
5. Click **Delete** to confirm

<Warning>
  Removing a credit deletes all roles associated with that song or album. This cannot be undone—you'll need to re-add it from Spotify if you want it back.
</Warning>

### Opening a Credit in Spotify

Each credit card has an **external link icon** button that opens the song or album directly in Spotify, so you can verify the credit or share it.

## Credits Display on Your Profile

### The Credits Tab

When visitors view your profile and click the **Credits** tab, they see:

1. **Total count** of your credited projects
2. **Role filter pills** to filter by specific contribution types
3. **Immersive credit cards** with cover art backgrounds
4. **Play buttons** that link directly to Spotify

### Filter Pills

If you have credits with multiple roles, filter pills appear above the grid:

- **All** — Shows every credit
- **Producer** — Only credits where you produced
- **Mixing Engineer** — Only mixing credits
- etc.

<Tip>
  Visitors can quickly see the scope of your expertise by filtering. If you're known for mixing, they can see all your mixing work at a glance.
</Tip>

### Card Design

Each credit card features:

- **Background** — Album/track cover art with gradient overlay
- **Type badge** — "Song" (green) or "Album" (purple)
- **Track count** — For albums, shows number of tracks from Spotify
- **Popularity indicator** — 3 dots showing track popularity on Spotify (high/medium/low)
- **Role badges** — Up to 2 visible, with "+N more" for additional roles
- **Title and artist** — Song name and performing artist
- **Release year** — When it was released

<Tip>
  The popularity indicator shows how popular a track is on Spotify. Three lit dots means high popularity (70+), two dots means medium (40-69), and one dot means lower popularity.
</Tip>

### Responsive Design

Credits display differently on mobile vs desktop:

| Device      | Card Shape         | Layout                 |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Mobile**  | Rectangular (16:9) | Single column, stacked |
| **Desktop** | Square             | 2-4 column grid        |

### Album Credits with Multiple Tracks

When you've credited multiple tracks from the same album, they're grouped together in the editor with a **stacked card visual effect**. This keeps your credits organized and shows visitors the scope of your work on larger projects.

---

## Unavailable Credits

Sometimes songs or albums are removed from Spotify (label issues, re-releases, etc.). When this happens:

- Credits are **not deleted** — they remain on your profile
- They display with a **dimmed appearance**
- A note indicates the track is "No longer available on Spotify"
- The Spotify link is disabled

<Info>
  BeatPass automatically checks credit availability weekly. If a track returns to Spotify, it will become active again.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Building a Strong Credits Section

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add your best work first">
    Lead with high-profile placements or projects you're most proud of. First impressions matter.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be accurate with roles">
    Only claim roles you actually performed. Misrepresenting credits damages your professional reputation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include diverse credits">
    Show range by including different types of work — production, mixing, features, etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep credits current">
    Add new placements as they release. An active credits section shows you're actively working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use album imports for efficiency">
    If you worked on multiple tracks from one project, add the entire album to save time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Makes Credits Valuable

Credits are especially powerful for:

- **New producers** — Establishes credibility without extensive catalog
- **Engineers** — Shows mixing/mastering portfolio beyond your own beats
- **Collaborators** — Highlights features and co-productions
- **Professionals** — Demonstrates industry experience to potential clients

## Empty State for Owners

If you haven't added any credits yet, you'll see a placeholder message in the Credits tab:

> "No credits added yet. Click 'Add Credit' to search Spotify for songs and albums you've worked on."

Click the **Add Credit** button to get started.

<Note>
  Only you (the profile owner) see this prompt. Visitors don't see an empty credits tab — it simply doesn't appear until you add credits.
</Note>
