# Professional Credits

Professional Credits let you showcase songs and albums you've worked on from Spotify directly on your BeatPass producer profile. Whether you've produced, mixed, mastered, or contributed to other artists' projects, credits help establish your credibility and build your professional portfolio.

## What Are Credits?

Credits are a way to highlight your production work beyond the beats you sell on BeatPass. They link to real releases on Spotify, giving visitors proof of your professional experience.

**Credits can showcase your role as:**

| Role Category | Example Roles |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Production** | Producer, Co-Producer, Beat Maker |
| **Engineering** | Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer, Recording Engineer |
| **Writing** | Songwriter, Composer, Arranger |
| **Performance** | Featured Artist, Vocalist, Musician |
| **Other** | Executive Producer, A&R, Creative Director |

<Info>
Credits appear in the **Credits** tab on your producer profile. Visitors can filter by role to see specific contributions.

## Understanding Credit Types

### Songs vs Albums

Credits are displayed differently based on type:

| Type | Display | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Song** | Individual card with cover art | One-off features, single productions |
| **Album** | Stacked card showing track count | Projects where you worked on multiple tracks |

<Frame caption="Album credits appear as stacked cards to show they contain multiple tracks">
  <img src="/assets/images/help/credits-album-stack.png" alt="Album credit with stacked card effect" />
</Frame>

### Multiple Roles

You can have **multiple roles on the same song**. Each role creates a separate credit entry, but they're grouped together visually:

- A song where you were Producer + Mixing Engineer shows both role badges
- Filter pills let visitors see all your work in a specific role

---

## Managing Your Credits

### Viewing Credits

Your credits appear in the **Credits** tab on your profile with:

- **Cover art** from Spotify
- **Song/Album name** and artist
- **Role badges** showing your contribution
- **Release year** 
- **Type indicator** (Song or Album)

### Editing a Credit

To change the role on an existing credit:

1. Go to your artist edit page → **Credits** tab
2. Find the credit you want to modify
3. Use the role dropdown to select a different role
4. Changes save automatically

### Removing a Credit

To remove a credit from your profile:

1. Go to your artist edit page → **Credits** tab
2. Find the credit you want to remove
3. Click the **×** (delete) button
4. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
Removing a credit cannot be undone. You'll need to re-add it from Spotify if you want it back.
</Warning>

## Credits Display on Your Profile

### The Credits Tab

When visitors view your profile and click the **Credits** tab, they see:

1. **Total count** of your credited projects
2. **Role filter pills** to filter by specific contribution types
3. **Immersive credit cards** with cover art backgrounds
4. **Play buttons** that link directly to Spotify

### Filter Pills

If you have credits with multiple roles, filter pills appear above the grid:

- **All** — Shows every credit
- **Producer** — Only credits where you produced
- **Mixing Engineer** — Only mixing credits
- etc.

<Tip>
Visitors can quickly see the scope of your expertise by filtering. If you're known for mixing, they can see all your mixing work at a glance.
</Tip>

### Card Design

Each credit card features:

- **Background** — Album/track cover art with overlay
- **Type badge** — "Song" (green) or "Album" (purple)
- **Track count** — For albums, shows number of tracks
- **Role badges** — Your contribution types
- **Title and artist** — Song name and performing artist
- **Release year** — When it was released
- **Play button** — Opens in Spotify on hover

---

## Unavailable Credits

Sometimes songs or albums are removed from Spotify (label issues, re-releases, etc.). When this happens:

- Credits are **not deleted** — they remain on your profile
- They display with a **dimmed appearance**
- A note indicates the track is "No longer available on Spotify"
- The Spotify link is disabled

<Info>
BeatPass automatically checks credit availability weekly. If a track returns to Spotify, it will become active again.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Building a Strong Credits Section

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add your best work first">
    Lead with high-profile placements or projects you're most proud of. First impressions matter.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be accurate with roles">
    Only claim roles you actually performed. Misrepresenting credits damages your professional reputation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include diverse credits">
    Show range by including different types of work — production, mixing, features, etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep credits current">
    Add new placements as they release. An active credits section shows you're actively working.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use album imports for efficiency">
    If you worked on multiple tracks from one project, add the entire album to save time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Makes Credits Valuable

Credits are especially powerful for:

- **New producers** — Establishes credibility without extensive catalog
- **Engineers** — Shows mixing/mastering portfolio beyond your own beats
- **Collaborators** — Highlights features and co-productions
- **Professionals** — Demonstrates industry experience to potential clients

## Empty State for Owners

If you haven't added any credits yet, you'll see an encouraging prompt on your Credits tab:

> "Showcase your work on other artists' projects. Add songs and albums you've produced, mixed, or contributed to from Spotify."

Click **Add Credits** to get started.

<Note>
Only you (the profile owner) see this prompt. Visitors don't see an empty credits tab — it simply doesn't appear until you add credits.
</Note>
