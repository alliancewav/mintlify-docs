# Photo Gallery

Your photo gallery helps visitors connect with you beyond your music. Share images of yourself, your studio setup, performances, and behind-the-scenes moments to build a stronger connection with your audience.

## Why Add Photos?

Photos make your profile more engaging and personal:
