# Verified Badge

The verified badge is a blue checkmark that appears next to a producer's name, indicating they've been confirmed as authentic by BeatPass. It's a mark of trust and credibility on the platform.

## What the Verified Badge Looks Like

When a producer is verified, a blue checkmark icon appears:

- **Next to your name** in your profile header
- **On your avatar** in various places across the platform
- **In search results** when people find your profile

Hovering over the badge shows a "Verified" tooltip.

## What Verification Means

The verified badge indicates:

- **Authentic identity** — You are who you say you are
- **Legitimate producer** — You're a real beat maker, not an impersonator
- **Trusted by BeatPass** — You've been reviewed and approved by our team

<Note>
Verification is about authenticity, not popularity. It's not a measure of how many beats you've sold or followers you have.
</Note>

## Verification Requirements

To be considered for verification, you typically need to demonstrate:

- **Active music career** — You regularly create and release beats
- **Authentic identity** — Your profile represents a real person or brand
- **Quality content** — Your music meets BeatPass quality standards

- Violate BeatPass terms of service
- Engage in deceptive practices
- Have your account suspended

### Does verification cost anything?

No. Verification is free and based on meeting our criteria, not on payment.

You can reapply after addressing the issues and building more presence on the platform.

## Verification vs. Subscription

Verification (the blue badge) is different from having a paid subscription:

| Feature | Verification | Subscription |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **What it is** | Identity authentication | Access to premium features |
| **How to get it** | Application process | Purchase a plan |
| **Visual indicator** | Blue checkmark badge | Pro badge on avatar |
| **Purpose** | Trust and authenticity | Download and licensing features |

<Note>
You don't need a paid subscription to apply for verification, and verification doesn't require a subscription. They are separate features.
