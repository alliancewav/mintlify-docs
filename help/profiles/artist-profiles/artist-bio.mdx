# Your Bio & Links

Your biography and social links help listeners connect with you beyond just your music. A well-written bio tells your story, while social links make it easy for fans to follow you everywhere.

## Writing Your Biography

Your bio appears in the **About** section of your producer profile. It's your chance to share who you are and what drives your music.

### What to Include

- **Your background** — How you got into making beats
- **Your style** — What makes your sound unique
- **Your influences** — Artists and genres that inspire you
- **Your achievements** — Notable placements, collaborations, or milestones
- **What you're working on** — Current projects or upcoming releases

### How to Add Your Bio

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Artist Profile">
    Navigate to your producer profile page on BeatPass.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Edit Menu">
    Click the **More** button on your profile, then select **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Biography Tab">
    Click on the **Biography** tab in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Description">
    Enter your bio in the **Description** field. You have plenty of room to tell your story.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Keep your bio engaging but concise. Visitors should be able to quickly understand who you are and what you're about. Break up long text into paragraphs for easier reading.
</Tip>

### Bio Tips

- **Be authentic** — Write in your own voice
- **Stay professional** — Remember this represents your brand
- **Update regularly** — Refresh your bio as your career evolves
- **Avoid links in bio** — Use the Links section instead (links in the description are not clickable)

<Warning>
URLs and links are not allowed in the Description field. They won't be clickable. Use the dedicated Links section to add your social profiles and website.
</Warning>

</Tip>

## How It Looks on Your Profile

Your bio and links appear in the **About** section of your producer profile:

| Element | Location |
|---------|----------|
| **Bio text** | Main content area, expandable for longer text |
| **Location** | Shows with a map pin and country flag |
| **Connect links** | Row of icon buttons linking to your socials |
| **Statistics** | Play counts and other metrics |
| **Genres** | Clickable genre tags |

## Best Practices

### For Your Bio

- Keep the first few sentences compelling—they appear before any "Show more" link
- Mention your main genres and style early
- Include any notable accomplishments
- Update it when you have news to share

### For Your Links

- Prioritize active social accounts
- Remove links to inactive profiles
- Keep links current—broken links look unprofessional
- Consider what platforms your target audience uses most
