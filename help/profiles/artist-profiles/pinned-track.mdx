# Pinned Track

Pinning a track lets you feature one beat prominently at the top of your discography. It's a powerful way to highlight your best work, a new release, or a beat you want visitors to hear first.

## What Is a Pinned Track?

When you pin a track:

- It appears at the very top of your **Discography** tab
- It's highlighted with a special pin icon
- Visitors see it before scrolling through your other beats
- It includes a play button for quick listening

Think of it as your "best foot forward" — the first impression visitors get of your sound.

## How to Pin a Track

You can pin a track from anywhere you see your beats on BeatPass:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Track">
    Locate the beat you want to pin in your discography or track list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Track Options">
    Right-click the track (or tap and hold on mobile) to open the context menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Pin Option">
    Click **Pin to top of discography**. The pin icon will rotate to show it's now pinned.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Look for the pushpin icon on your tracks. When a track is pinned, the icon appears rotated and highlighted.
</Tip>

## How to Unpin a Track

To remove a pinned track:

1. Find the currently pinned track at the top of your discography
2. Hover over it to reveal the unpin button (an X icon)
3. Click the unpin button to remove it from the featured spot

Alternatively, right-click the track and select **Unpin from top**.

## What Makes a Good Pinned Track?

Choose a track that:

- **Represents your sound** — First-time visitors will judge you by this beat
- **Is high quality** — Your best production and mix
- **Is popular** — Already getting good engagement
- **Is current** — A recent release keeps your profile fresh

### When to Change Your Pin

Consider updating your pinned track when:

- You release a new beat you're proud of
- An older track is getting renewed attention
- You want to highlight seasonal or themed content
- Your pinned track is getting stale

<Note>
You can only pin one track at a time. Pinning a new track automatically unpins the previous one.
</Note>

## Where the Pinned Track Appears

Your pinned track displays at the top of the **Discography** tab on your producer profile:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pin icon** | A pushpin icon indicates this is your featured track |
| **Track image** | The beat's cover art |
| **Track name** | Title of the beat |
| **Artist info** | Your name (and collaborators if any) |
| **Duration** | Length of the track |
| **Play count** | How many times it's been played |
| **Play button** | Quick access to start listening |

## Pinned Track vs. Top Tracks

Your profile may show both a pinned track and your top tracks:

| Section | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Pinned Track** | One track you've manually selected to feature |
| **Top Tracks** | Your most popular beats based on plays and engagement |

The pinned track appears first, followed by your top tracks. This gives you control over first impressions while still showcasing your proven hits.

## Best Practices

- **Update regularly** — Keep your profile fresh with new featured content
- **Match your brand** — Pin a track that represents your current direction
- **Consider your audience** — Feature what your target listeners want to hear
- **Test and iterate** — Try different pinned tracks to see what resonates

<Tip>
Some producers pin their newest release for a few weeks, then switch to their all-time best performer. Find what works for your audience.
</Tip>

## Mobile Experience

On mobile devices:

- The pinned track appears prominently at the top of your discography
- Tap to play the track
- Long-press to access the context menu for unpinning
