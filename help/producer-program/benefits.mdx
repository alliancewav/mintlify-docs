## Revenue & Earnings

### Keep 100% of Your Price

You keep 100% of whatever price you set for your beats. The platform fee is paid by buyers on top of your price—not deducted from your earnings.

**How it works:**

| You Set | Buyer Pays | You Receive | Platform Gets |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| $50 | $57.50 | $50 | $7.50 |
| $100 | $115 | $100 | $15 |
| $200 | $230 | $200 | $30 |

The 15% platform fee is added to the buyer's total, so you always receive exactly what you charge.

### Multiple Income Streams

Earn from different sources:

- **Non-exclusive downloads** — Members with paid subscriptions can download your beats
- **Exclusive licenses** — Sell exclusive rights to your beats at premium prices
- **Plays** — Contribute to subscription pool revenue based on track popularity

---

## Upload & Catalog

### Unlimited Uploads

There's no cap on how many beats you can upload. Build as large a catalog as you want without worrying about hitting limits.

### Catalog Management

Access your full catalog through the Producer Dashboard:

- View all your tracks in one place
- See performance stats for each beat
- Update metadata, tags, and descriptions
- Manage album organization
