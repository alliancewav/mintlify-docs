## Step 1: Choose Your Application Type

Before filling out the form, select the right application for your situation:

| If you... | Choose... |
|-----------|-----------|
| Don't have a producer profile yet | **Become a Producer** |
| Have music already on BeatPass but no account access | **Claim Artist Profile** |
| Already have a producer profile and want verification | **Get Verified** |

Click your **profile avatar**, then select **Backstage** to see all application options.

---

## Step 2: Fill Out the Application

### Profile Setup

Depending on your application type:

- **Become a Producer** — Enter your producer name (how you'll be known on BeatPass)
- **Claim Artist Profile** — Search for and select the existing artist profile
- **Get Verified** — Your existing profile is already linked

You can also upload a profile picture during this step.

### Personal Details

Provide your real information:

- **First name** (required)
- **Last name** (required)
- **Company or label** (optional) — If you're signed or represent an organization

For Claim Artist applications, you'll also select your role (e.g., artist, manager, label representative).

### Supporting Materials

Provide links and files to support your application:

- **Link to your beats** (required) — URL where your music can be heard
- **Instagram handle** (optional) — Helps with identity verification
- **Attachments** (optional) — Additional documents or images

### Discord Community

You're encouraged to join the BeatPass Discord community. For Get Verified applications, Discord membership is required.

### Agreement

Before submitting, you must confirm:

1. Agreement to [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/privacy-policy)
2. Ownership of all beats you'll upload
3. Granting BeatPass a non-exclusive license to distribute your music
4. Commitment to uploading at least 2 beats per month

---

## Step 3: Submit Your Application

Once you've filled out all required fields and checked both agreement boxes, click **Submit Application**.

You'll be taken to a confirmation page showing that your application was received.

---

## Step 4: Wait for Review

The BeatPass team reviews applications to ensure:

- Quality of your beats meets platform standards
- Information provided is accurate
- You're a legitimate producer

Most applications are reviewed quickly. You'll receive an email notification when a decision is made.

---

## Step 5: Receive Your Decision

### If Approved

You'll receive an email confirming your approval. You can then:

- Access your Producer Dashboard
- Start uploading beats
- Set up your payout information
- Customize your producer profile

See [After Approval](/help/producer-program/after-approval) for next steps.

### If Denied

If your application isn't approved, you'll receive an email explaining why. Common reasons include:

- Beat quality doesn't meet standards
- Missing or incomplete information
- Unable to verify identity

You can address the issues and apply again.

## Application Status

You can check your application status at any time by clicking your **profile avatar** → **Backstage**.

| Status | Meaning |
