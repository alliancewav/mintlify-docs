The "Claim Artist Profile" application is for producers whose music is already on BeatPass under an artist name, but who don't have account access to that profile. This connects the existing profile to your account.

---

## Who Should Use This

Choose this application if:

- You see your music on BeatPass under an artist name
- You don't currently control that artist profile
- You want to take ownership of your existing catalog

If you're starting fresh with no existing music on BeatPass, use [Become a Producer](/help/producer-program/application-types/become-artist) instead.

---

## How It Works

When you claim an artist profile:

1. You search for and select the existing profile
2. The BeatPass team verifies you're the rightful owner
3. Once approved, the profile is linked to your account
4. You gain full control over the catalog, analytics, and earnings

## Step-by-Step Application

Click your **profile avatar** → **Backstage**, then select **Claim Existing Artist** (or **Claim Profile**).

### 2. Select the Profile

Search for the artist profile you want to claim. As you type, matching profiles appear.

**Important:** After selecting a profile, the system checks if it's available:

- **Available** — The profile can be claimed (green confirmation)
- **Already Claimed** — Someone else owns this profile (red warning)

If a profile is already claimed but you believe you're the rightful owner, [contact support](/help/contact-support).

### 3. Personal Details

- **First name** (required)
- **Last name** (required)
- **Your role** (required) — Select how you relate to this profile
- **Company or label** (optional)

### 4. Supporting Materials

Provide links and documents to prove ownership:

- **Link to your beats** (required) — URL showing you control this music
- **Instagram handle** (optional) — Helps verify your identity
- **Attachments** (optional) — Documents proving ownership

### 5. Join Discord

You're encouraged to join the BeatPass Discord community. While not required, it's helpful for getting support during the claim process.

### 6. Agreement

Check both boxes to confirm:

1. You agree to the [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/privacy-policy)
2. You own all rights to the beats, grant BeatPass a non-exclusive license, and commit to uploading at least 2 beats per month

## Claim Verification

The BeatPass team reviews claims carefully to prevent unauthorized access:

- The team checks that the profile isn't already owned
- Your connection to the music is verified
- Additional documentation may be requested

This process protects both you and other artists from fraudulent claims.

## What Happens Next

### Application Review

The team verifies:

- The profile is available to claim

- Your supporting materials check out

### Decision Notification

You'll receive an email when a decision is made:

- **Approved** — The profile is now linked to your account
- **Denied** — You'll receive feedback on why the claim wasn't approved

### After Approval

Once approved:

- The artist profile is linked to your account

## Roles When Claiming

When claiming a profile, you select your relationship to the artist:

| Role | Who uses this |
|------|---------------|
| **Artist** | You are the producer/artist |
| **Manager** | You manage the artist |
| **Label** | You represent the artist's label |
| **Other** | Another authorized role |

Your role affects how the profile is set up and what permissions you receive.

## What If the Profile Is Already Claimed?

If you see "Already Claimed" when selecting a profile:

1. The profile is owned by another user
2. You cannot claim it through the normal process
3. [Contact Support](/help/contact-support) to resolve ownership disputes

Disputed claims are investigated to ensure the rightful owner has access.
