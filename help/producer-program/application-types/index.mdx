There are three ways to join the BeatPass Producer Program, depending on your current situation. Choose the option that fits you best.

## Which Application Type Is Right for You?

| If you... | Choose... | What happens |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Are new to BeatPass and want to start uploading | **Become a Producer** | A new producer profile is created for you |
| See your music on BeatPass but don't control the profile | **Claim Artist Profile** | You gain ownership of the existing profile |
| Already have a producer profile and want verification | **Get Verified** | A verified badge is added to your profile |

---

## Become a Producer

**Best for:** Producers who don't have any profile on BeatPass yet.

This application creates a brand new producer profile linked to your account. You'll choose your producer name and start fresh.

  Full details on the Become a Producer application.
</Card>

**What you need:**
- Your producer name
- Link to your beats
- First and last name

## Claim Artist Profile

**Best for:** Producers whose music is already on BeatPass (perhaps added by the platform or a label) but who don't have account access to that profile.

This application connects an existing artist profile to your account, giving you full control over the catalog and earnings.

**What you need:**

- Link to your beats

<Note>
You can only claim profiles that aren't already owned by another user. If a profile shows as "Already Claimed," contact support for assistance.
</Note>

## Get Verified

**Best for:** Producers who already have a working producer profile on BeatPass and want to add a verified badge.

Verification happens through the BeatPass Discord community, not through a traditional application form.

  Full details on the Get Verified process.
</Card>

**What you need:**
- An existing producer profile on BeatPass

   - Yes → Try **Claim Artist Profile**
   - No → Go with **Become a Producer**

2. **Do you already have a working producer account?**
   - Yes → Consider **Get Verified**
   - No → Choose **Become a Producer** or **Claim Artist Profile**
