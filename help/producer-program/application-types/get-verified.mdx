The "Get Verified" option is for producers who already have a working profile on BeatPass and want to add a verified badge. Unlike other applications, verification happens through the BeatPass Discord community—not a traditional form.

---

## Who Should Use This

Choose this option if:

- You already have a producer profile on BeatPass
- You can upload beats and access the Producer Dashboard
- You want a verified badge on your profile

If you don't have a producer profile yet, use [Become a Producer](/help/producer-program/application-types/become-artist) or [Claim Artist Profile](/help/producer-program/application-types/claim-artist) first.
