The "Become a Producer" application is for producers who don't have any existing profile on BeatPass. This creates a brand new producer profile linked to your account.

---

## Who Should Use This

Choose this application if:

- You're new to BeatPass
- You don't see any of your music on the platform already
- You want to create a fresh producer profile

If your music is already on BeatPass under an artist name, use [Claim Artist Profile](/help/producer-program/application-types/claim-artist) instead.

## What You'll Need

|-------------|---------|

| **Link to your beats** | URL to your music (SoundCloud, YouTube, etc.) |
| **First and last name** | Your real name for verification |
| **Profile picture** (optional) | Professional image for your profile |
