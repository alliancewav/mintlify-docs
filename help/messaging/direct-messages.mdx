Direct messages let you have private one-on-one conversations with any user on BeatPass. Whether you're connecting with a producer, discussing a potential collaboration, or following up on a beat request, direct messages are the easiest way to communicate privately.

## Starting a New Conversation

There are two ways to start a direct message conversation:

### From the Message Panel

1. Click the **message icon** (chat bubble) in the navigation bar
2. Click the **+** button at the top of the panel
3. Type a name, username, or producer name in the search field
4. Click on the user you want to message
5. Type your message in the text field
6. Press **Enter** or click the **send icon**

<Tip>
  When you open the new message screen, you'll see a list of users you already follow — making it quick to start conversations with people in your network.
</Tip>

### From a User's Profile

1. Visit the user's profile page
2. Click the **Message** button
3. The messaging panel opens with that user selected
4. Type your message and send

<Info>
  If you've messaged this user before, clicking **Message** will open your existing conversation instead of starting a new one.
</Info>

## Finding Users to Message

BeatPass makes it easy to find users when starting a new conversation:

### Search Options

You can search by:
- **Name** — First or last name
- **Email** — Their email address
- **Username** — Their @username handle
- **Producer name** — The name they use as a producer on BeatPass

### Followed Users

When you open the new message screen without typing anything, you'll see a list of **users you follow** (up to 20). This makes it quick to message producers and friends you've already connected with on the platform.

## Sending Messages

### How to Send

Type your message in the input field at the bottom of the conversation. The input field features a modern frosted glass design with rounded corners and automatically expands as you type longer messages.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- Press **Enter** to send your message
- Press **Shift + Enter** to add a new line without sending
- Click the **send icon** (arrow) to send

### Message Limits

- Maximum **2,000 characters** per message
- A character counter appears when you're near the limit (shows at 80% capacity)
- Text messages only — images and file attachments are not supported

### Sending Tips

- Keep messages clear and concise
- Use **Shift + Enter** to format longer messages with line breaks
- Break long messages into multiple shorter ones for readability
- Your message is sent instantly — there's no undo once sent

## Viewing Conversations

### Conversation List

Your conversations appear in the message panel, sorted by **most recent activity**. Each conversation shows:

- **User avatar and name** — Who you're chatting with
- **Last message preview** — A snippet of the most recent message (prefixed with "You:" if you sent it)
- **Timestamp** — When the last message was sent
- **Unread badge** — Shows the number of unread messages
- **Read status** — Green double checkmarks (✓✓) appear if the recipient has read your last message

### Opening a Conversation

Click on any conversation to open it and view the full message history. Messages appear in chronological order with the newest at the bottom.

### Message Display

Each message shows:
- **Sender's avatar** — Small profile picture (aligned at the bottom of message bubbles)
- **Message text** — The content of the message in a styled bubble
- **Timestamp** — When it was sent (visible on hover or for the last message in a group)
- **Read status** — For your sent messages, shows "Sent" or "Seen" below the message bubble

---

## Replying to Messages

When you receive a message:

1. Click on the conversation in your message list
2. The conversation opens showing all messages
3. Type your reply in the text field at the bottom
4. Press **Enter** or click the send icon

<Note>
  Opening a conversation automatically marks all messages as read. The sender will see that you've seen their messages.
</Note>

---

## Message Timestamps

Messages display timestamps that update based on how recent they are:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Today** | Messages sent today |
| **Yesterday** | Messages sent yesterday |
| **Full date** | Older messages (e.g., "November 15, 2025") |

Within a conversation, messages are grouped by date with separators showing when the conversation date changes.

---

## Loading Message History

When you open a conversation, BeatPass loads your most recent messages. As you scroll up toward the top of the conversation, older messages load automatically. This keeps the app fast while giving you access to your full message history.

---

## Conversation Persistence

Direct message conversations stay in your message list until you delete them. Even if you don't message someone for months, you can pick up where you left off.

<Info>
  If you delete a conversation and the other person messages you again, a new conversation will appear automatically with their new message.
</Info>
