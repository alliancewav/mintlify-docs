## Your Conversation List

### How Conversations Are Sorted

Your conversations are always sorted by **most recent activity** — the conversation with the newest message appears at the top. This makes it easy to see what's new and continue active discussions.

### What You See

Each conversation in your list shows:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Avatar** | Profile picture of the other person (or group indicator for group chats) |
| **Name** | Their display name or the group title |
| **Preview** | First few words of the last message |
| **Time** | When the last message was sent |
| **Badge** | Number of unread messages (if any) |

## Deleting Conversations

### How to Delete

1. Open the conversation you want to delete
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) in the conversation header
3. Confirm when prompted

<Warning>
  Deleting a conversation removes it from your message list, but doesn't delete the messages for the other person. They can still see the full conversation history.
</Warning>

### What Happens When You Delete

When you delete a conversation:
- It disappears from your message list
- You won't see old messages anymore
- The other person's conversation is unaffected
- You remain a participant — you can still receive new messages from them

### Automatic Reappearance

If someone sends you a new message after you've deleted the conversation:
- The conversation will reappear in your list
- You'll see the new message
- Previous message history remains hidden from your view

<Info>
  This design ensures you never miss important new messages, even from conversations you've previously deleted.
</Info>

## Mark as Read / Unread

### Marking as Read

When you open a conversation, all messages are automatically marked as read. This:
- Removes the unread badge from the conversation
- Updates the message icon badge count in the navigation bar
- Sends read receipts to the sender (so they know you've seen their messages)

### Marking as Unread

Want to remind yourself to follow up on a conversation? You can mark it as unread:

1. Open the conversation
2. Click the menu icon (⋮)
3. Toggle the read status

This adds the unread badge back to the conversation, making it stand out in your list and increasing your unread count in the navigation bar.

<Tip>
  Use "Mark as Unread" as a to-do reminder. It's a great way to flag conversations that need your attention later.
</Tip>

### Unread Badge Count

The message icon in the navigation bar shows your total unread message count. This updates automatically as you:
- Receive new messages (count increases)
- Open and read conversations (count decreases)
- Mark conversations as unread (count increases)

## Finding Conversations

### Scrolling Your List

Your 20 most recent conversations load automatically. Scroll down to load older conversations as needed.

### Looking for Someone Specific?

If you can't find a conversation:
1. Click the **+** button
2. Search for the person's name
3. If you've messaged them before, selecting them opens the existing conversation

---

## Conversation Actions

All conversation management options are available through the menu (⋮) in the conversation header:

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Mark as Read/Unread** | Toggles the unread badge for reminder purposes |
| **Delete** | Removes conversation from your list |
| **View Profile** | Opens the other person's profile (direct messages only) |
| **Follow/Unfollow** | Quick toggle to follow the person you're chatting with |

## Keeping Your Inbox Organized

### Best Practices

- **Delete old conversations** you no longer need to keep your list focused
- **Mark important messages as unread** if you need to respond later
- **Check regularly** to stay on top of new messages

### When to Delete

Consider deleting conversations that are:
- Old and no longer relevant
- Spam or unwanted messages
- Completed discussions you don't need to reference

### When to Keep

Keep conversations that:
- Contain important information you may need later
- Are ongoing discussions
- Include details about collaborations or agreements

<Note>
  There's no limit to how many conversations you can have. Keep whatever is useful to you.
</Note>

## Privacy Considerations

### Deleting Doesn't Erase

Remember that deleting a conversation only removes it from **your** view:
- The other person still has access to the full conversation
- Messages are not permanently erased from the system
- BeatPass retains message data according to the [Privacy Policy](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/privacy-policy)

### Unwanted Messages

If you're receiving unwanted messages from someone:
1. Delete the conversation to remove it from your inbox
2. Report the user through their profile if they're violating the [Content Guidelines](/help/legal/content-guidelines)
3. Contact support at contact@beatpass.ca if the behavior continues

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I deleted a conversation but it came back">
    This happens when the other person sends a new message. Deleting only hides the conversation — it doesn't block the user from messaging you again. The conversation reappears when they send new messages so you don't miss anything important.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My unread count seems wrong">
    The unread count updates in real time but may occasionally need a refresh. Try closing and reopening the message panel. If the issue persists, refresh the page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't find a conversation I know I had">
    You may have deleted it previously. Try starting a new conversation with that user — if you've messaged before, they may still have the conversation history on their end.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I recover deleted messages?">
    Once you delete a conversation, you cannot recover the message history on your end. The other participant still has access to the messages on their side.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
