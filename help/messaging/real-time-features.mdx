BeatPass messaging includes real-time features that make conversations feel natural and responsive. You can see when someone is typing a reply and know when your messages have been read.

## Typing Indicators

### What They Look Like

When someone is typing a message to you, you'll see a **typing indicator** appear in the conversation showing their name. This lets you know a message is on its way.

### How They Work

- **Appears quickly** — Shows shortly after the other person starts typing
- **Disappears automatically** — When they stop typing or send their message
- **Updates in real time** — No need to refresh or reload

### In Group Conversations

In group chats, typing indicators show which participants are currently typing. If multiple people are typing at once, you'll see all of them listed.

<Note>
  Typing indicators are only visible while you have the conversation open. They don't appear as notifications.
</Note>

## Read Receipts

### Understanding Read Status

BeatPass shows you when your messages have been seen by the recipient. This helps you know if they've received your message or if you should follow up.

### Status Indicators

Messages you send show different states:

| Indicator            | Meaning                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Single checkmark** | Message sent and delivered |
| **Double checkmark** | Message has been read      |

### How Read Receipts Work

- Messages are marked as read when the recipient **opens the conversation**
- All unread messages in the conversation are marked read at once
- You can see the read status on each message you've sent

### In Direct Messages

In one-on-one conversations, the read receipt tells you when the other person saw your message.

### In Group Conversations

In groups, read receipts show when **any** participant has read the message. Multiple people reading the message updates the status.

<Info>
  Read receipts are automatic and cannot be turned off. When you open a conversation, the sender is notified that you've seen their messages.

## Instant Message Delivery

### How Fast Are Messages?

Messages on BeatPass are delivered **instantly**:

- Your message appears immediately after you send it
- The recipient sees it within seconds
- No noticeable delay in most cases

### Live Updates

You don't need to refresh to see new messages:

- New messages appear automatically in open conversations
- The conversation list updates when new messages arrive
- Unread counts update in real time

### New Message Indicator

When a new message arrives while you're scrolled up in a conversation:

- A **floating indicator** appears showing who sent the new message
- Click it to jump to the latest messages
- Or continue reading and scroll down when ready

---

## How Real-Time Works

BeatPass uses modern technology to keep messaging responsive:

### For Open Conversations

When you have a conversation open:

- Messages update very frequently
- Typing indicators update nearly instantly
- Read receipts sync automatically

### Background Updates

When you're not in the message panel:

- Unread counts still update
- You'll receive notifications for new messages (based on your notification settings)
- Opening the panel shows the latest state

## Privacy & Real-Time Features

### What Others Can See

| Feature               | What They See                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Typing indicators** | When you're actively typing    |
| **Read receipts**     | When you open the conversation |
| **Online status**     | Not shown on BeatPass          |

### What You Control

- Read receipts are automatic and cannot be turned off
- Typing indicators cannot be hidden while typing
- You can delete conversations to remove them from your inbox

<Tip>
  If you want to read a message without triggering a read receipt, there's no way to do that in BeatPass messaging. Opening the conversation always marks messages as read.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Real-Time Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Typing indicator isn't showing">
    Typing indicators require both users to have the conversation open. If the indicator isn't appearing, the other person may not be actively typing or the conversation may not be open on their end.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Messages aren't updating automatically">
    Try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, check your internet connection. Real-time features require a stable connection to work properly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Read receipts seem delayed">
    Read receipts are triggered when the recipient opens the conversation. If they haven't opened it yet, the receipt won't show. Give it some time — they may just be busy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I see typing but no message came">
    The person may have started typing and then stopped without sending. Typing indicators disappear after a few seconds of inactivity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Responsive Conversations

### Be Aware of Read Receipts

Remember that when you open a conversation, the other person knows you've seen their message. If you open it, consider responding — or at least acknowledge that you'll respond later.

### Typing Indicators Set Expectations

When someone sees you're typing, they expect a message soon. If you need to stop and think:

- It's okay to take your time
- The indicator disappears after a few seconds of not typing
- No pressure to send immediately

### Stay Connected

For the best real-time experience:

- Keep a stable internet connection
- Leave BeatPass open in a browser tab
- Check the message icon for unread counts
