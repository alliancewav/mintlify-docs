## Who Can You Message?

You can send messages to any BeatPass user with an account. There are no restrictions on who you can reach out to—producers, subscribers, and free users can all communicate with each other.

<Note>
  BeatPass messaging is designed for legitimate communication. Users who send spam or harassing messages may have their messaging privileges suspended.
</Note>

## Message Notifications

When someone sends you a message, you'll be notified based on your notification settings:

- **Browser** — Real-time browser push notifications (requires permission)
- **Email** — Receive emails when you get new messages
- **In-App** — Shows in your notification center and as a badge count on the message icon

### Configuring Notifications

1. Navigate to `/notifications/settings` or click the notification bell icon and select **Settings**
2. Find the **Messages** section
3. Toggle **Direct Messages** on or off for each channel (Email, Browser, In-App)
4. Click **Save Preferences**

<Info>
  The unread message count badge on the message icon updates automatically as new messages arrive and disappears when you read them.
</Info>

## Message Character Limit

Each message can contain up to **2,000 characters**. If you need to share more content, consider breaking it into multiple messages or sharing a link.

## Privacy & Safety

Your conversations are private between you and the other participants. BeatPass does not read or monitor your messages unless a report is submitted for review.

<Warning>
  **Never share sensitive information** like passwords, payment details, or personal addresses through messaging. BeatPass will never ask for this information via DM.
</Warning>

If you receive inappropriate messages:

1. You can delete the conversation to remove it from your inbox
2. Report the user through their profile if the behavior violates the [Content Guidelines](/help/legal/content-guidelines)
