Group conversations let you chat with multiple people at the same time. They're perfect for coordinating collaborations, discussing projects with a team, or connecting with a group of people on the platform.

## Creating a Group Conversation

### Step by Step

1. Click the **message icon** (chat bubble) in the navigation bar
2. Click the **+** button at the top of the panel
3. Search for and select **at least 2 other users**
4. Continue selecting additional users as needed
5. Type your first message
6. Press **Enter** or click the **send icon**

The group conversation is created automatically when you send your first message.

<Note>
  Group conversations require **at least 3 participants** (you plus 2 others). If you only select one person, it will create a direct message instead.
</Note>

## Group Conversation Names

### Automatic Naming

When you create a group, BeatPass automatically generates a name based on the participants:

- **"Alex, Jordan, Sam"** — Shows first names of up to 3 participants
- **"Alex, Jordan, Sam and 2 others"** — If there are more than 3 participants

### Custom Names

You can provide a custom title when creating the group to make it easier to identify:

- **"Beat Collab Project"**
- **"Producer Network"**
- **"Album Discussion"**

<Tip>
  Choose a descriptive name that helps everyone in the group understand what the conversation is about.
</Tip>

## How Group Conversations Work

### Sending Messages

Sending messages in a group works the same as direct messages:

1. Open the group conversation
2. Type your message in the text field
3. Press **Enter** or click the send icon

Your message is instantly visible to all participants in the group.

### Viewing Messages

Messages in a group show:
- **Sender's avatar and name** — So you know who sent each message
- **Message text** — The content of the message
- **Timestamp** — When it was sent

### Real-Time Updates

Group conversations support all the same real-time features as direct messages:
- **Typing indicators** — See when someone in the group is typing
- **Read receipts** — Know when participants have seen your messages
- **Instant delivery** — Messages appear immediately for all participants

## Group vs. Direct Messages

| Feature | Direct Message | Group Conversation |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Participants** | 2 (you + 1 other) | 3+ (you + 2 or more) |
| **Naming** | Shows other person's name | Auto-generated or custom title |
| **Typing indicators** | Shows when they're typing | Shows all who are typing |
| **Read receipts** | Shows when they read | Shows when anyone reads |
| **Best for** | Private 1-on-1 chats | Collaborations & teams |

## Managing Group Participants

### Who's in the Group

You can see all participants in a group conversation by looking at the group title in the conversation header.

### Adding New Members

Group membership is set when the conversation is created. To include additional people, you would need to create a new group conversation with the expanded participant list.

### Leaving a Group

If you want to leave a group conversation:

1. Open the group conversation
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) in the conversation header
3. Confirm deletion when prompted

This removes the conversation from your message list. Other participants will still have access to the group and can continue the conversation.

<Info>
  If someone in the group messages after you've left, the conversation will reappear in your message list with the new message.

## Best Practices for Groups

### Keep It Organized

- Use descriptive group names for project-based conversations
- Create separate groups for different topics or projects
- Keep groups focused on their purpose

### Communication Tips

- Everyone in the group sees all messages — there's no @mention feature
- Be mindful of message volume in active groups
- Use direct messages for private side conversations

### Group Size

Groups work best with:
- **3-10 participants** for active discussions
- Larger groups for announcements or broader coordination

---

## Common Use Cases

### Collaboration Projects

Working on a beat with multiple producers? Create a group to:
- Share ideas and feedback
- Coordinate timelines
- Discuss creative direction

### Beat Request Discussions

When multiple producers are interested in a beat request:
- Create a group with the requestor
- Discuss requirements together
- Share progress updates

### Community Building

Connect with a group of producers or fans:
- Share new releases
- Discuss industry news
- Build relationships

## Notifications in Groups

Group conversations follow your standard message notification settings. You'll receive notifications for:
- **New messages** in groups you're part of
- Based on your configured channels (Email, Browser, In-App)

<Warning>
  Active groups can generate many notifications. Consider adjusting your notification settings if you're in several busy groups.
</Warning>
