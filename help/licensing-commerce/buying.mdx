## What Your Subscription Includes

### Non-Exclusive Downloads (Included)

With a paid subscription (Classic, Plus, or Pro), you can:

- **Download unlimited beats** with instant non-exclusive licensing
- **Use downloaded beats commercially** with a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license (see license terms)
- **Keep your license forever**—even after subscription ends

### What Subscriptions Do NOT Include

| Not Included | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Exclusive licenses** | Must be purchased separately; removes beat from catalog |
| **Blanket catalog rights** | You must download each beat you want to use |
| **Stems (usually)** | Stems are included with exclusive purchases; for non-exclusive, contact the producer |
| **Offline streaming** | Streaming requires internet; downloaded files work offline |

<Warning>
  **Free accounts cannot download beats via subscription.** Free users can browse, preview, and save to library. Any track you purchase is always downloadable regardless of subscription status, but subscription-based downloads still require the `music.download` permission.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Choose Your License

### License Types

| Type | How to Get It | What's Included |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Non-Exclusive** | Download with subscription | MP3/WAV, worldwide, perpetual non-exclusive license (beat stays in catalog) |
| **Exclusive** | Separate purchase | All files + stems, beat removed from catalog, only you can use it |

### Non-Exclusive (Subscription Downloads)

When you download a beat with your subscription:

- You get a **non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license** under BeatPass subscription terms
- Other artists can also license the same beat
- You receive **MP3 and WAV** files
- Stems are **not included by default**; you may request them directly from the producer, who may choose to provide them separately

### Exclusive (Separate Purchase)

To get exclusive rights:

1. Click **Buy Exclusive** on the track page
2. Pay the producer's exclusive price (discounted for subscribers)
3. The beat is **removed from the catalog**—no one else can license it
4. You receive **all files including stems**

### Understanding Your Rights

| License Type | Stream Limits | Other Artists | Your Obligations |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Non-Exclusive** | Unlimited | Can use same beat | Credit producer |
| **Exclusive** | Unlimited | No one else | Credit producer |

<Note>
  **Producer credit is required** for all releases (e.g., "Prod. by [Name]"). See your license certificate for the exact format.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Already licensed a beat non-exclusively and want exclusivity? Contact the producer—but note that existing non-exclusive licenses from other artists remain valid.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>

    **No.** With a paid subscription, you can download unlimited beats. Each download grants a non-exclusive license for that beat. Exclusive licenses are the only separate purchase.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
    Digital licenses are generally non-refundable once files are downloaded. Contact support for issues with defective files.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the beat on YouTube/Spotify?">
    Yes. Both non-exclusive and exclusive licenses allow commercial distribution on all platforms. Your license certificate resolves any Content ID claims.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when someone buys exclusive?">
    The beat is removed from the catalog. **Your existing non-exclusive license remains valid forever**—you can continue using the beat in your project. No new licenses will be sold.

  <Accordion title="How do I get stems?">
    **Exclusive purchases** include stems automatically. For **non-exclusive downloads**, stems may be available—contact the producer via messaging to request them.
