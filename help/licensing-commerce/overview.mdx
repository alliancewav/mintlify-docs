### Exclusive License Presets

Save time by creating reusable exclusive license configurations:

    Go to **Backstage \> Settings \> License Presets** and create a new preset with your preferred exclusive pricing, terms, and restrictions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set as Default">
    Mark a preset as your default to auto-apply to all new uploads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply to Tracks">
    When uploading, your default preset pre-fills exclusive pricing. Override per-track if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Presets ensure consistent exclusive pricing across your catalog without re-entering details for each track. See [API Endpoints](/api/endpoints#exclusive-license-presets) for programmatic access, and [Licensing Models & Exclusive Availability](/product-guides/licensing-models-exclusive) for how presets interact with Standard vs Exclusive models in Backstage.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade from non-exclusive to exclusive?">

    Your license remains valid. Keep your certificate as proof of purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use licensed beats for sync (TV/Film)?">
    Standard licenses may not cover sync. Contact the producer for sync-specific licensing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are refunds available?">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
