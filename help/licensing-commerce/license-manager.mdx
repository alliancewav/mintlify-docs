## Managing Your Licenses

Use the search bar to find licenses by:

- Track name

    Locate the license in your License Manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Download">
    Click the **Download** button on the license card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Certificate">
    A branded PDF certificate opens in a new tab. Use your browser's print function to save as PDF.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Keep Your Certificates!** Download and store your license certificates locally. They serve as proof of licensing rights and may be required by distributors, labels, or in dispute situations.
</Tip>

## License Verification

Every license can be verified publicly using its unique UUID.

### Verifying a License

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the License UUID">
    Find the UUID on the license card or certificate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit Verification Page">
    Navigate to `https://open.beatpass.ca/verify-license/{UUID}`

    Or click the **Verify License** button on the license card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Verification Results">
    The page displays:

    - License validity status
    - Track information
    - License type and terms
    - Issue date
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verification outcomes

When you verify a license, the status will show one of three outcomes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Active" icon="circle-check" color="#22c55e">
    🟢 The license is valid and currently usable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revoked" icon="ban" color="#ef4444">
    🔴 The license was invalidated (for example, due to chargebacks, fraud investigations, or a dispute ruling).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expired" icon="clock" color="#eab308">
    🟡 The license term has ended. For non-exclusive licenses, this only appears if the license was issued with a fixed term and the `expires_at` date has passed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Understanding `expires_at` for non-exclusive licenses

Most non-exclusive licenses on BeatPass are perpetual. When a non-exclusive license includes a term limit, the verification page will show an `expires_at` timestamp indicating when the allowed usage window ends. If that date is blank, the license does not have a fixed expiry.

### What to do if a license shows as invalid or expired

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Buyers / Artists" icon="user-exclamation" color="#f97316">
    - Double-check that you entered the correct license UUID from your certificate.
    - If status is **Expired**, consider purchasing a new license or contacting the producer to discuss renewal options.
    - If status is **Revoked**, stop using the track commercially and reach out to support with your purchase receipt and certificate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Producers" icon="shield-exclamation" color="#fb7185">
    - Confirm the license UUID belongs to your catalog and matches the intended licensee.
    - If you revoked the license, ensure you have documented the reason (chargeback, dispute, or terms violation) in case of inquiries.
    - For expired non-exclusive licenses with `expires_at`, reach out to the buyer with renewal or upgrade options if appropriate.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why Verification Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Artists" icon="user-check">
    - Prove licensing rights to distributors
    - Resolve copyright disputes
    - Document chain of ownership
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Producers" icon="shield-check">
    - Verify license authenticity
    - Track who has licensed your work
    - Support dispute resolution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Public Verification** — Anyone with a license UUID can verify its authenticity. This allows labels, distributors, and platforms to confirm licensing rights.
</Note>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long do licenses last?">
    Most BeatPass licenses are **perpetual** — they don't expire as long as they remain in good standing. The license terms specify exact duration and usage rights.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a license be revoked?">
    Licenses can be revoked in cases of:

    - Terms of service violations
    - Fraudulent activity
    - Successful copyright disputes
    - Payment chargebacks

    You'll be notified if a license status changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I can't find my license">
    If a recently acquired license isn't showing:

    1. Wait a few minutes for processing
    2. Refresh the page
    3. Check your email for license confirmation
    4. Contact support if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer a license to someone else?">
    License transfers depend on your license type. Non-exclusive licenses are generally non-transferable. Exclusive licenses may have transfer provisions — check your license terms or contact support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if the producer deletes the track?">
    Your license remains valid even if the original track is removed from the platform. Keep your downloaded files and license certificates as documentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a license for every track I download?">
    Yes. Each download generates a separate license. This ensures clear documentation of your rights to use each track commercially.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
