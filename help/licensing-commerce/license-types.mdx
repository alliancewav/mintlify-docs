## Overview

BeatPass supports multiple **licensing models** per track so you can combine subscription-powered non-exclusive usage with one-time exclusive sales. This page explains how Standard, Standard + Exclusive, and Exclusive Only behave in the Backstage form and in the buyer experience.

## Licensing Models at a Glance

In Backstage, each track has a **Licensing Model** setting. It maps to the following internal values:

| UI Label | Internal value | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Standard Licensing** | `non_exclusive_only` | Beat is available for non-exclusive use only (subscription / standard licensing). No direct exclusive sale is offered. |
| **Standard + Exclusive** | `both` | Beat is available for both non-exclusive use and an optional exclusive purchase. |
| **Exclusive Only** | `exclusive_only` | Beat is only available as an exclusive purchase (no new non-exclusive licenses). |

<Note>
  Non-exclusive ("Standard") licenses on BeatPass are **not customized per track**. They follow the platform's standard non-exclusive terms described in [License Terms Explained](/help/legal/license-terms) and [Beat Licensing Guide](/help/licensing-commerce/overview).
</Note>

---

## Standard Licensing (Non-Exclusive Only)

**When to use:** You want people to stream and download your beat non-exclusively (for example, via subscription), and you **do not** want to sell exclusives for this track.

- **Licensing Model:** `Standard Licensing` (non-exclusive only)
- **Availability:**
  - Beat remains in the catalog.
  - Subscribers can download and receive non-exclusive licenses per BeatPass standard terms.
- **Exclusive price & config:**
  - Exclusive-specific fields are hidden or ignored in this mode.

This is the safest default for catalog tracks you plan to keep widely available.

---

## Standard + Exclusive

**When to use:** You want to keep earning from non-exclusive usage **and** optionally sell a one-time exclusive license.

- **Licensing Model:** `Standard + Exclusive` (`both`)
- **Before exclusive sale:**
  - Subscribers and non-exclusive buyers can obtain non-exclusive licenses.
  - An exclusive buyer can purchase once if you set:
    - **Exclusive price** and **currency**
    - A valid **exclusive license configuration** (preset or custom)
- **After exclusive sale:**
  - The tracks `exclusive_status` is set to **Sold**.
  - Backstage locks exclusive pricing and availability controls.
  - **No new non-exclusive licenses** are issued after the exclusive sale.
  - Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid for their full terms.
  - Download access is limited to:
    - The exclusive buyer, and
    - The tracks artists/owners.

<Warning>
  Treat exclusives as **final**. Once a track is sold exclusively, BeatPass blocks new non-exclusive licenses and restricts downloads to the exclusive buyer and owners. Existing non-exclusive licenses issued before the exclusive sale remain valid and are not revoked.
</Warning>

---

## Exclusive Only

**When to use:** You want to offer a track only as a high-value exclusive and not include it in non-exclusive catalogs.

- **Licensing Model:** `Exclusive Only` (`exclusive_only`)
- **Before exclusive sale:**
  - The track can be discoverable (streamed) depending on your global settings.
  - No non-exclusive licenses are issued; usage is tied to the exclusive purchase.
- **Exclusive availability:**
  - Controlled by **Exclusive Status**:
    - **Available**  track can be purchased exclusively.
    - **Private (Not available)**  exclusive purchase button is disabled; you can still keep the track online or private in your catalog.
- **After exclusive sale (status = Sold):**
  - Same post-sale rules as Standard + Exclusive:
    - No new licenses are issued.
    - Only the exclusive buyer and owners can download.

There is no separate "offer only" or "price on request" mode today. If you want to discuss custom pricing, use your profile/contact info and keep the status set to **Private** until youre ready to enable the exclusive price publicly.

---

## Exclusive Pricing & Availability (Backstage UI)

In the **Exclusive Pricing & Availability** section of the Backstage track form, you control how exclusive sales appear.

Key fields:

- **Exclusive Price**
  - One-time upfront amount the buyer pays for the exclusive.
  - Must be greater than 0 to enable purchases.

- **Currency**
  - One of the supported major currencies (for example, USD, EUR, GBP, CAD).
  - Determines the checkout currency for exclusive purchases.

- **Contact Email for Licensing Inquiries**
  - Shown to potential buyers.
  - Auto-filled from your account email if left blank.

- **Exclusive Status**
  - **Available**  exclusive purchase is offered.
  - **Sold**  exclusive has been purchased; pricing and status are locked.
  - **Private**  exclusive is not currently offered, even if a price is set.

<Note>
  The combination of **Licensing Model** and **Exclusive Status** controls whether an exclusive can be purchased:

  - `Standard + Exclusive` or `Exclusive Only` **and** status = `Available` and a valid price/config = **purchasable**.
  - Status = `Private` or `Sold` = **not purchasable**.
</Note>

## Exclusive License Configuration

Exclusive licenses on BeatPass are customizable by the producer. The configuration controls **what rights buyers receive** when they purchase exclusively.

Configuration covers:

- **Publishing split** (producer vs licensee percentages)
- **Territory & governing law**
- **Distribution and streaming caps** (typically set to unlimited)
- **Video and broadcast rights**
- **Performance rights** (for-profit and non-profit)
- **Files to deliver** (e.g., WAV, tagged WAV, MP3s, stems, multitracks, MIDI)
- **Producer royalty percentage**
- Flags such as **exclusive rights**, **transferability**, and **content ID registration**.

When an exclusive license is issued:

- BeatPass stores a **snapshot** of the exact terms at the time of purchase.
- Future changes to your presets/configuration do **not** alter existing certificates; they only affect **later** licenses.

For legal wording of these rights, see [License Terms Explained](/help/legal/license-terms).

---

## Exclusive Presets & Defaults

To avoid re-configuring every track from scratch, you can use **presets** and **defaults**.

- **Exclusive License Presets**
  - Saved templates that include a full exclusive configuration.
  - Managed under **Backstage → Settings → License Presets**.
  - Each preset tracks how many tracks are using it.

- **Artist Default Exclusive Config**
  - A personal default exclusive configuration stored for your account.
  - Used to auto-populate new tracks when you enable exclusive licensing.

### How They Interact with the Track Form

When you open the exclusive configuration for a track:

1. If the track already has a custom config, that config is shown.
2. Otherwise, if you have a saved **artist default**, it is applied.
3. If not, BeatPass falls back to the **system default** exclusive config.

You can then:

- Select a different preset to overwrite the config for that track.
- Click **Use Default** to reset to the global default.

<Note>
  Presets and defaults only control the **terms** of an exclusive license. They do **not** change your Standard (non-exclusive) subscription license, which remains fixed and managed by BeatPass.
</Note>

## What Happens When an Exclusive Sells?

When an exclusive purchase succeeds:

- The tracks **exclusive status** is set to **Sold**.
- Backstage locks:
  - Licensing Model options that would re-enable non-exclusive sales
  - Exclusive status and price
  - Exclusive currency and buyer info fields
- BeatPass generates an **exclusive license certificate** with:
  - The buyers info
  - The track details
  - The snapshot of exclusive terms
  - A linkable verification ID

### Impact on Other Listeners

- **New non-exclusive licenses**
  - Are **no longer issued** after the exclusive sale.
  - Subscribers cannot newly download/licence the beat once it is sold exclusively.

- **Existing non-exclusive licenses**
  - **Remain valid** for their original terms.
  - They are not revoked or downgraded.

- **Downloads**
  - Allowed for:
    - The exclusive buyer (with an active exclusive license), and
    - The tracks artists/owners.
  - Blocked for other users, even if they subscribe.

<Warning>
  Selling exclusives on popular catalog beats can permanently restrict future non-exclusive monetization. Consider using **Standard + Exclusive** with careful pricing and timing if you want to earn from both phases (non-exclusive first, exclusive later).
</Warning>

## Coupons, Taxes & Pricing Behavior

Direct track purchases (including exclusives) use a simple pricing model:

- **Track price**
  - For exclusives: `exclusive_price`.
  - For non-exclusive direct sales (if offered): `price`.
- **Platform fee**
  - A percentage added **on top** of your price.
  - Kept by BeatPass to fund the platform.
- **Artist amount**
  - Equal to your base track price; Stripe processing fees are deducted from this portion.

The `POST /tracks/{track}/purchase/calculate-price` API returns:

- `track_price`, `platform_fee`, `total_amount`, `artist_amount`, `currency`.

### Coupons & Discounts

- Today, BeatPass does **not** apply coupons or promotional discounts directly to track purchases.
- Any coupons you see in the app apply to subscriptions or other flows, not to exclusive track pricing.

### Taxes & VAT

- Any applicable taxes are handled by Stripe based on your and the buyers region and account configuration.
- They are not itemized in the `calculate-price` response; tax lines appear in Stripes checkout.

For a deeper look at subscription revenue and platform fees, see [Plans & Subscriptions](/help/account-security/plans-subscriptions).

## FAQ: Common Licensing Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my non-exclusive buyers if I sell an exclusive?">
    Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid for their full terms. The exclusive sale **stops new non-exclusive licenses from being issued**, but it does not cancel or downgrade licenses that were granted before the exclusive sale.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I pause exclusive availability without unlisting my track?">
    Yes. Set your **Exclusive Status** to **Private** (Not available). This keeps the track online (for streaming and any allowed non-exclusive usage) while hiding the exclusive purchase option.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I re-enable standard sales after an exclusive sale?">
    No. Once a track is sold exclusively and marked as **Sold**, BeatPass treats that sale as final:
    
    - New non-exclusive licenses are not issued.
    - The track cannot be re-opened for fresh non-exclusive or exclusive sales through normal Backstage controls.
    
    Existing non-exclusive licenses granted before the exclusive sale remain valid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do subscription downloads count as non-exclusive licenses?">
    Yes. When a subscriber downloads a beat that supports non-exclusive licensing, they receive a non-exclusive license under BeatPasss standard terms. These licenses remain valid even if the track is later sold exclusively.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can coupons apply to exclusive purchases?">
    Not currently. Track purchasesincluding exclusivesdo not support promotional coupons or discounts in the checkout flow. Any coupons you see apply to subscriptions or other non-track flows.
  </Accordion>
