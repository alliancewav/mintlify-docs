## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I bought an exclusive—can I sell my song to a label?">
    Generally yes. Exclusive licenses typically allow you to commercially exploit your recording, including label deals. However, verify your specific terms and note that you're selling your song/recording, not the underlying beat rights.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Someone else released a song with 'my' beat">
    If you have a non-exclusive license, other artists can also license the same beat. Only exclusive licenses guarantee sole use.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the beat in multiple songs?">
    Typically no—one license covers one song/recording. Contact the producer if you want to use it for multiple projects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to credit the producer on streaming platforms?">
    Check your license terms. Non-exclusive licenses typically require credit. Add the producer as a "Producer" or in the song credits field.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I want to change the beat significantly?">
    Most licenses allow reasonable arrangement changes (adding/removing sections, adjusting mix). Major alterations or sampling for new beats typically isn't allowed. When in doubt, ask.
  </Accordion>
