Albums on BeatPass are collections of beats grouped together by a producer. They might represent a themed project, a compilation of similar beats, or a cohesive body of work. Albums make it easy to explore a producer's vision and find multiple beats that work well together.

## Finding Albums

You can discover albums in several ways:

- **From the homepage** — Browse featured albums in homepage channels
- **From a producer's page** — Visit the **Albums** tab on any producer profile
- **Through search** — Search for album names or keywords
- **From genre pages** — Albums are often featured in genre-specific channels

## What's on an Album Page

At the top of an album page, you'll see:
