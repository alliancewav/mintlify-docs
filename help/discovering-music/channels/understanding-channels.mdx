Channels are the building blocks of content discovery on BeatPass. Understanding how they work will help you navigate the platform more effectively and find exactly what you're looking for.

## What Is a Channel?

A channel is a curated collection of content organized around a specific theme or criteria. Each channel can contain:

- **Beats** — Individual tracks from producers
- **Albums** — Collections of beats
- **Playlists** — User-created or curated compilations
- **Producers** — Artist profiles
- **Genres** — Musical style categories
- **Other channels** — Nested channels for deeper organization

## How Channels Are Organized

### By Theme

Channels group content by common characteristics:
- **New Releases** — The latest uploads
- **Trending** — Popular content right now
- **Staff Picks** — Hand-selected by the BeatPass team
- **Seasonal** — Holiday or event-themed collections

### Personalized

Some channels are unique to each user:
- **For You** — Personalized recommendations based on your listening history

### By Genre

Genre-specific channels showcase content within a musical style:
- Hip-Hop, R&B, Trap, Pop, Electronic, and more

### By Content Type

Some channels focus on a specific type of content:
- **Top Producers** — Featured artist profiles
- **Popular Albums** — Trending collections
- **Featured Playlists** — Curated playlist compilations

## Channel Structure

### Channel Header

When you visit a channel's full page, you'll see:
- **Channel name** — The title describing the collection
- **Description** — Additional context about the channel (if available)
- **Navigation controls** — Arrows or buttons to browse content

### Channel Content

The main area displays items from the channel. Content can be shown in various layouts depending on the channel type:
- Grid of cards
- Horizontal carousel
- Vertical list
- Data table

### Nested Channels

Some channels contain other channels inside them. This creates a hierarchical browsing experience. For example, a "Discover" channel might contain:
- "New This Week" (sub-channel)
- "Rising Producers" (sub-channel)
- "Popular Playlists" (sub-channel)

## Browsing Channels

### From the Homepage

The homepage displays previews of multiple channels. Each preview shows a sample of the channel's content. Click **View more** to see the full channel.

### Channel Pages

- See all content in the channel

### Navigation Tips

- **Arrow buttons** — Click navigation arrows to move through content
- **View more** — Expands to show the full channel page

## Content Ordering

Channels organize content by different criteria:

- **Most popular** — Ordered by plays and engagement
- **Recently added** — Newest content first
- **Release date** — Based on when the content was released
- **Curated order** — Hand-picked arrangement by the channel creator

The ordering depends on how the channel was configured and may not always be visible to you.

<Tip>
When exploring a new channel, start by scrolling through the first few items to get a sense of what the channel contains. If it matches what you're looking for, click "View more" to dive deeper.
