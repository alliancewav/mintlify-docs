Channels are curated collections of content on BeatPass. They organize beats, albums, producers, and playlists into themed groupings that make discovery easy and enjoyable.

## What Are Channels?

Think of channels as organized shelves in a music store. Each channel groups related content together based on a theme, genre, popularity, or other criteria. Instead of scrolling through thousands of individual beats, you can browse channels that match your interests.
