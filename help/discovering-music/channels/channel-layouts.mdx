Channels on BeatPass can display content in several different layouts. Each layout is designed for a specific type of browsing experience, making it easy to discover content in the way that works best.

## Layout Types

### Grid Layout

The grid layout displays content as a collection of cards arranged in rows and columns.

**Best for:**
- Browsing many items at once
- Visual discovery based on artwork
- Full channel pages with lots of content

**How to use:**
- Scroll down to see more rows
- Click any card to view that item
- Hover over a card to see quick actions (like play)

### Carousel Layout

The carousel layout displays content in a horizontal row that you can scroll through.

**Best for:**
- Previewing channels on the homepage
- Quick horizontal browsing
- Showcasing featured content

**How to use:**
- Click the left/right arrow buttons to scroll
- Swipe left/right on touch devices
- Click any item to view details

### List Layout

The list layout shows content in a vertical, text-focused format.

**Best for:**
- Viewing beat details at a glance
- Scanning through many tracks quickly
- When artwork isn't the primary focus

**How to use:**
- Scroll down to see more items
- Click any row to play or view details
- Use column headers to sort (when available)

### Table Layout

The table layout presents beats in a detailed spreadsheet-like view with multiple columns of information.

**Best for:**
- Viewing detailed track information
- Comparing beats by duration, popularity, etc.
- Power users who want all the details

**How to use:**
- Scroll to see more tracks
- Click column headers to sort by that field
- Click any row to play the track
- Hover for additional action buttons

### Nested Slider Layout

The nested slider layout combines multiple carousels into a single flowing view, with sections that slide into view as you scroll.

**Best for:**
- Complex channels with multiple sub-sections
- Immersive browsing experiences
- Genre pages with diverse content types

**How to use:**
- Scroll vertically to reveal new sections
- Each section slides in from the side
- Browse horizontally within each section

## Layout Behavior

### Responsive Design

All layouts automatically adjust based on your screen size:
- **Desktop** — Full layouts with all features
- **Tablet** — Adjusted grid columns and touch-friendly controls
- **Mobile** — Optimized single-column views and swipe gestures

### Quick Play

In most layouts, you can start playing content without leaving the channel:
- **Hover** over an item to reveal the play button
- **Click play** to start listening immediately
- **Keep browsing** while music plays in the background

### Infinite Scrolling

Large channels may use infinite scrolling:
- Content loads automatically as you scroll down
- No need to click "next page" buttons
- Smooth, continuous browsing experience

## Which Layout Will I See?

The layout you see depends on:

1. **Channel configuration** — How the channel was set up
2. **Content type** — Beats may show differently than producers
3. **Context** — Preview on homepage vs. full channel page

You don't choose the layout—it's determined by the channel type and where you're viewing it. However, some full channel pages may offer layout options.

<Tip>
On channel pages with lots of content, look for filter options to narrow down what you're looking for instead of scrolling through everything.
