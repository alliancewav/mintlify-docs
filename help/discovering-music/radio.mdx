## The Radio Player

When you start a radio station, you'll see:

- **Station name** — Shows what the radio is based on (e.g., "Drake radio" or "Hip-Hop radio")
- **Radio type** — Indicates if it's Artist radio, Track radio, or Genre radio
- **Track count and duration** — Total number of tracks and approximate listening time
- **Play button** — Start or pause playback

Below the header, you'll see the list of recommended tracks that make up your radio station.

## Radio Features

- **Fresh every time** — Each time you start a radio station, you'll get a different mix of recommended beats
- **Continuous playback** — Music keeps playing until you stop it or reach the end of the playlist
- **Sortable list** — Rearrange the track list by clicking column headers
- **Full track controls** — Like, add to playlist, or view details for any track in the radio queue

## Tips for Better Radio

- **Start specific** — Starting from a specific beat often gives better results than starting from a broad genre
- **Try different seeds** — If you don't like the recommendations, try starting radio from a different beat or producer
- **Explore producers** — When you hear something you like, click through to the producer's profile to find more of their work
