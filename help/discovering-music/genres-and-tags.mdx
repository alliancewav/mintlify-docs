Genres and tags help you find beats that match your style. Genres organize beats by musical style, while tags are flexible keywords that describe specific characteristics like mood, tempo, or vibe.

## Browsing by Genre

Genres are broad musical categories that help organize beats into recognizable styles. Common genres on BeatPass include Hip-Hop, R&B, Trap, Pop, and many more.

### Finding Genre Pages

You can access genre pages in several ways:

1. **From the homepage** — Click on genre cards or links displayed in genre channels
2. **From search** — Search for a genre name and click the result
3. **From a beat page** — Click on any genre tag shown on a beat

### What's on a Genre Page

Each genre page features:

- **Genre header** — The genre name and a visual background that represents the style
- **Multiple content sections** — Beats, albums, and playlists organized within that genre
- **Top producers** — Artists who create content in this genre
- **Radio option** — Start a genre-based radio station

### Genre Page Features

On a genre page, you can:

- **Browse beats** — See all beats tagged with that genre
- **Explore albums** — Find collections and albums in the genre
- **Discover producers** — See who's making music in this style
- **Start genre radio** — Create a continuous mix of beats from the genre

## Browsing by Tags

Tags are descriptive keywords that producers add to their beats. They're more specific than genres and can describe things like:

- **Mood** — Dark, uplifting, chill, aggressive
- **Style** — Type beat, drill, melodic, boom bap
- **Characteristics** — Hard-hitting, smooth, ambient
- **Use case** — Commercial, freestyle, hook

### Finding Tag Pages

Click on any tag you see on a beat or album page to view all content with that tag. Tags appear as clickable chips or labels, usually starting with a `#` symbol.

### What's on a Tag Page

Tag pages show:

- **Tag name** — The specific keyword or phrase
- **All tracks** — Every beat that includes this tag
- **All albums** — Collections tagged with this keyword

Tags make it easy to find beats with very specific characteristics that might not fit neatly into a single genre.

## Genre vs. Tags: What's the Difference?

| Aspect | Genres | Tags |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Scope** | Broad musical categories | Specific descriptive keywords |
| **Examples** | Hip-Hop, R&B, Pop, Electronic | Type beat, dark, melodic, drill |
| **Set by** | Platform and producers | Producers when uploading |
| **Navigation** | Dedicated genre channels | Clickable labels on content |

## Tips for Discovering Content

- **Start with a genre** if you know the general style you want
- **Use tags** when you have a specific vibe or characteristic in mind
- **Combine your approach** — Browse a genre, then filter by tags that interest you
- **Check producer pages** — If you find a beat you love, explore what else that producer has made

<Tip>
When viewing a beat, look at both its genre and tags. The tags often reveal more specific details about the beat's style that can help you find similar content.
