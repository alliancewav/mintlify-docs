Every producer on BeatPass has a dedicated profile page where you can explore their music, learn more about them, and connect with their work. Producer pages are your destination for diving deep into a specific artist's catalog.

## Finding a Producer Page

You can get to a producer's page in several ways:

- **Click their name** on any beat, album, or playlist
- **Search** for the producer's name
- **Browse trending artists** on the homepage
- **Explore similar artists** from another producer's page

## What's on a Producer Page

### Profile Header

At the top of every producer page, you'll see:

- **Profile picture** — The producer's avatar image
- **Producer name** — Their name, with a verification badge if they're verified

  - **Follow** — Follow to stay updated on their new releases
  - **Message** — Send a direct message (if the producer has enabled messaging)
  - **More** — Additional options like starting radio or sharing

### Verified Producers

Some producers have a blue verification badge next to their name. This indicates that the profile has been verified as belonging to an established or notable producer.
