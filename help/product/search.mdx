## Using Filters Effectively

### Combining Filters

Filters are **additive** (AND logic):

```
Genre: Trap + BPM: 140-150 + Key: Minor
→ Returns trap beats at 140-150 BPM in a minor key
```

### Filter Reset

Click **Clear Filters** to reset all filters and start fresh.

## Search Tips

### Finding Specific Styles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Drake-style beats" icon="microphone">
    Search **"drake type"** or filter R&B/Trap + 80-100 BPM
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dark trap" icon="moon">
    Search **"dark trap"** or use Mood: Dark + Genre: Trap
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lo-fi study beats" icon="book">
    Search **"lo-fi chill"** or filter Lo-Fi + 70-90 BPM
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Festival EDM" icon="bolt">
    Search **"festival"** or filter Electronic + 128 BPM
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using Tags Effectively

Tags are highly weighted in search. Try:

- Mood tags: "dark", "chill", "aggressive"
- Style tags: "melodic", "hard", "bouncy"
- Influence tags: "metro boomin type", "pierre bourne style"
- Use case: "freestyle", "hook", "commercial"

### Exact Phrase Search

For specific phrases, use quotes:

```
"summer vibes"     → Matches exact phrase
summer vibes       → Matches tracks with both words anywhere
```

## Search Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start broad, then narrow">
    Begin with general terms, then add filters to refine. Starting too specific may miss relevant results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use BPM ranges">
    Instead of exact BPM (140), use a range (138-142) to catch tracks with slight variations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine key + mood">
    Searching "minor key" alone is broad. Add mood: "dark minor" or filter by minor keys + Dark mood.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Try artist influence tags">
    Many producers tag their beats with artist influences: "travis scott type", "juice wrld style", etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check spelling">
    Search has limited typo tolerance. "melodick" won't find "melodic".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Power User Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Exact Phrase" icon="quote-left">
    Use `"dark trap"` (with quotes) for exact matching
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-term" icon="layer-group">
    `melodic guitar emotional` — combine terms freely
  </Card>
  <Card title="BPM Matching" icon="gauge">
    Filter to ±2 BPM of your vocal track
  </Card>
  <Card title="Producer Search" icon="user">
    Enter producer name directly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  <Accordion title="Filters not working">
    - Ensure filters aren't too restrictive
    - Some combinations yield few results
    - Try resetting filters and adding one at a time
