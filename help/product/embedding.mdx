## Embedding Beats

### Track Embed URL

BeatPass supports track embedding using the following URL format:

```
https://open.beatpass.ca/track/{track-id}/{track-slug}/embed
```

### Basic Embed Code

Embed a player on any website:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://open.beatpass.ca/track/123/midnight-chase/embed"
  width="100%"
  height="152"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="autoplay"
></iframe>
```

<Note>
  The embed URL uses the same track path as the track page, with `/embed` appended. You can find the exact URL from the share menu on any track.
</Note>

### Embed Sizing

| Size | Dimensions | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Compact | 100% × 80px | Minimal integration |

## Best Practices

### Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lazy Loading">
    Use lazy loading for pages with multiple embeds:
    ```html
    <iframe loading="lazy" ...></iframe>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Responsive Design">
    Wrap in a container for responsive sizing:
    ```html
    <div style="max-width: 600px;">
      <iframe width="100%" ...></iframe>
    </div>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limit Embeds Per Page">
    Too many embeds slow page load. Limit to 3-5 per page.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Accessibility

- Include descriptive titles on iframes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Test keyboard navigation

## Terms of Use

### Embedding Guidelines

- Embeds must link back to BeatPass
- Don't modify embed code to hide attribution
- Commercial sites may embed with proper licensing
- Don't use embeds for spam or misleading purposes

### Attribution

Embedded players include automatic BeatPass branding. This cannot be removed without explicit agreement.

---

## Technical Constraints

### HTTPS Required

Embeds must be served over HTTPS. The embed will not load on HTTP-only sites.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

If your site uses CSP headers, you must allow framing from BeatPass:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: frame-src https://open.beatpass.ca;
```

### Browser Autoplay Policies

Modern browsers restrict autoplay. The embedded player:

- Will not autoplay audio without user interaction
- Requires a click/tap to begin playback
- May show a play button overlay until interaction

This is a browser security feature, not a BeatPass limitation.
