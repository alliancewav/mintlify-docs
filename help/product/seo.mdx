## Overview

BeatPass automatically optimizes your profile, tracks, and albums for search engines like Google and Bing. We use advanced "Schema.org" structured data to help your music appear in rich results, knowledge panels, and voice search answers.

<Info>
  **Automatic Optimization:** You don't need to configure technical SEO settings. Just ensure your metadata (titles, descriptions, tags) is complete, and we handle the code.

## Rich Search Results

We implement specific schemas that allow your content to appear as "Rich Results" in search.

### Music & Artist Cards

When users search for your artist name or tracks, they may see:

- **Knowledge Panel:** A dedicated box with your artist info, social links, and top songs.
- **Track Cards:** Rich displays of your singles with cover art and play buttons.
- **Album Carousels:** Lists of your albums and EPs.

### FAQ Snippets

Your artist and track pages include "Frequently Asked Questions" data that can appear directly in Google search results, answering common questions about licensing your beats.

## Voice Search Optimization

BeatPass is optimized for voice assistants like **Siri**, **Google Assistant**, and **Alexa**.

### "Speakable" Content

We mark specific parts of your profile (like your bio and track descriptions) as "speakable." This allows voice assistants to read your content aloud when users ask questions like:

- _"Who is [Producer Name]?"_
- _"What is the BPM of [Track Name]?"_

## How to Improve Your SEO

While we handle the technical side, your content determines your ranking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Your Profile">
    Fill out your **Bio**, **Location**, and **Social Links**. Search engines use this to verify your identity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Descriptive Titles">
    Use clear, descriptive titles for your tracks. Avoid generic names like "Beat 1". _Good:_ "Midnight Rain | Dark R&B Trapsoul"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detailed Descriptions">
    Write unique descriptions for your albums and top tracks. Mention the mood, instruments used, and inspiration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accurate Metadata">
    Ensure **BPM**, **Key**, and **Genre** are correct. These are used as filters in search results.
  </Step>
</Steps>
