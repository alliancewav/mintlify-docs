## Overview

Spotlight track pinning lets you feature a single track at the top of your profile. It is ideal for new releases, licensing campaigns, or highlighting your best-selling beat.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Artists & producers with published tracks **Time to complete:** 1-2 minutes

## Pin a Spotlight Track

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Backstage Catalog">
    Go to **Backstage → Catalog** to see your published tracks. Hover or tap a track row to reveal the **Pin to profile** control.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Spotlight">
    Select **Pin to profile**. The current spotlight (if any) is replaced immediately. Only one track can be pinned at a time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify on Your Profile">
    Visit your public profile to confirm the spotlight renders above releases, playlists, and other modules.

## Unpin or Replace

- **Replace**: Pinning a new track automatically unpins the previous spotlight.
- **Unpin**: Use **Unpin track** from the same catalog control to return your profile to a standard layout with no hero track.
- **Drafts & archived tracks**: Draft or archived tracks cannot be pinned. If a pinned track is archived, the spotlight slot hides until you pin another.

---

## Visibility Rules

- **Public profiles**: The spotlight appears to all visitors, including anonymous listeners. Plays, saves, and purchases from the spotlight are tracked normally.
- **Private profiles**: The pinned track is visible only to you and collaborators with backstage access. Public visitors see a standard layout with no spotlight slot until you make the profile public again.
- **Blocked or geofenced regions**: Users who cannot stream the track due to blocks or territory limits see the slot hidden to avoid broken playback.

<Warning>
  Switching a profile from public to private hides the spotlight for visitors, but the pin remains stored. When you return to public mode, the spotlight immediately reactivates.
</Warning>

## Layout & Playback Behavior

- The spotlight tile renders above releases, playlists, and the follow banner so it is the first playable element on desktop and mobile.
- On mobile, the spotlight remains sticky while scrolling through the top of the page; once the visitor scrolls past, the standard layout resumes.
- If you embed your profile elsewhere, the embedded layout uses the same pinned track so your brand stays consistent.

---

## Analytics & Reporting

- **Impressions & plays**: Spotlight impressions are tracked separately from regular grid tiles to measure hero placement performance.
- **Engagement split**: Saves, follows, and purchases initiated from the spotlight count toward overall track metrics and producer contribution formulas.
- **Change history**: When you re-pin a different track, analytics continue per-track; no historical data is lost for previously pinned tracks.

<Note>
  You can view spotlight performance in **Backstage → Analytics → Track Breakdown**. Look for the **Spotlight** badge in the per-track table.
</Note>
