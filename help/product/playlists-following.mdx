<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Library">
    Navigate to **Library > Playlists**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New">
    Click **New Playlist** and enter a name.
  </Step>

</Steps>

### Playlist Privacy

| Setting | Who Can See |
|---------|-------------|
| **Private** | Only you |
| **Public** | Anyone with the link, appears in search |

### Collaborative Playlists

Share playlist editing with others:

1. Open your playlist
2. Click **Settings > Collaborators**
3. Invite users by username
4. Collaborators can add/remove tracks

<Note>
  Only the playlist owner can delete the playlist or change privacy settings.
</Note>

### Joining a Collaborative Playlist

Understand how invites work before you start editing:

- **Owner requirements:** The playlist must be marked **Collaborative** before an invitation can be sent, and owners can't invite themselves. Duplicate or pending invites are rejected.
- **Invite delivery:** Invitations arrive via in-app notifications. If the owner rescinds access or you decline, related notifications are cleaned up automatically.
- **Accepting vs. declining:** Invited editors appear as "pending" until they accept. Accepting unlocks editing privileges; declining removes the pending invite. Editing isn't allowed until you accept.
- **Owner removal edge case:** If the owner removes themselves from collaborators, the playlist is deleted. All other removals simply revoke editing access and clear any related invites.
