## Audio File Requirements

### Single Track File

Each track on BeatPass consists of **one audio file** — your full mixdown.

<Info>
  BeatPass does not support stem uploads. Each track is a single, complete audio file. If buyers need stems, arrange delivery separately after purchase.
</Info>

### Watermarks

BeatPass automatically adds audio watermarks to preview streams:

## Replacing Audio

### When to Replace Audio

- Fixed mixing/mastering issues
- Updated arrangement
- Corrected audio glitches
- Improved stem quality

### Replace Audio Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Track">
    Go to **Backstage > Tracks** and select the track.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit Track">
    Click **Edit** to open the track editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replace Audio File">
    Upload the new audio file. This replaces the existing file entirely.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Replacement">
    Review changes and save. The track will be re-processed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important: What Happens on Replacement

<Warning>
  Audio replacement has significant implications:
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Analytics" icon="chart-line" color="#22c55e">
    Play counts and engagement data are **preserved**
  </Card>
  <Card title="Existing Licenses" icon="file-shield" color="#22c55e">
    Previous holders retain their **original** downloaded files
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Licenses" icon="file-arrow-down" color="#3b82f6">
    New purchasers receive the **updated** audio
  </Card>

    All streams switch to new audio **immediately**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  If you've sold licenses, consider whether replacement is appropriate. License holders purchased the original version. For major changes, uploading a new track may be more appropriate.
</Note>

## Metadata Best Practices

### Title Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do">
    - Keep it short and memorable (2-4 words)
    - Use descriptive keywords
    - Make it searchable
    - Example: "Midnight Chase", "Summer Waves"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't">
    - Use generic names ("Beat 1", "Untitled")
    - Include "Type Beat" unless strategic
    - Use special characters
    - Make it too long
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tag Strategy

Effective tagging improves discovery:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Mood | dark, uplifting, aggressive, chill |
| Style | melodic, hard, bouncy, atmospheric |
| Use Case | freestyle, hook, verse, commercial |
| Influence | drake type, metro boomin style |

<Tip>
  Use 5-10 tags per track. Too few limits discovery; too many dilutes relevance.
</Tip>

### BPM Accuracy

Accurate BPM helps artists find matching beats:

| Genre | Typical BPM Range |
|-------|-------------------|
| Trap | 130-170 |
| Hip Hop | 80-100 |
| Drill | 140-150 |
| R&B | 60-90 |
| Lo-Fi | 70-90 |

---

## Quality Score Impact

Your upload choices affect your Quality Score:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Complete metadata | High positive |
| High-quality audio | High positive |
| Cover art | Medium positive |
| Missing BPM/Key | Significant negative |
| Low bitrate audio | Significant negative |

<Card title="Analytics Dashboard" icon="chart-bar" href="/help/analytics/dashboards">
  Monitor your Quality Score in Backstage Insights.
</Card>

---

## Bulk Uploads

For multiple tracks:

1. Prepare a folder with properly named files
2. Create a metadata spreadsheet
3. Contact support for bulk upload assistance
4. Use consistent naming conventions

<Note>
  Bulk upload tools are in development. Currently, tracks must be uploaded individually.
</Note>

---

## After Publishing

### Track Management

- **Edit**: Update metadata anytime from Track Manager
- **Archive**: Hide from public without deleting
- **Delete**: Permanently remove (affects historical data)

### Monitor Performance

Check your track's performance in Backstage Insights:
- Play count and completion rate
- Save count
- Contribution value
- Audience demographics
