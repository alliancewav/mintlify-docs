Every track on BeatPass has one of three sample clearance statuses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Cleared (Sample-Safe™ Warranty)" icon="shield-check">

    - All elements are original compositions
    - Any samples used have proper clearance documentation
    - The track is safe for commercial releases
    - No third-party copyright claims are expected

    <Note>
      Tracks with "Cleared" status display a green **Sample-Safe™ Warranty** badge on the track page.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="⚠️ Requires Clearance" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Contains Uncleared Samples**

    - Buyer is responsible for obtaining necessary clearances
    - Not recommended for major commercial releases without legal review

    <Warning>

    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="❓ Status Unknown" icon="circle-question">

## Sample-Safe™ and Licensing

### Non-Exclusive Licenses

For non-exclusive licenses, Sample-Safe™ status applies to all purchasers equally:

- All buyers receive the same warranty protection
- Status is displayed prominently on the track page
- Notes are visible to all potential buyers

### Exclusive Licenses

For exclusive licenses, Sample-Safe™ becomes even more important:

  </Accordion>
