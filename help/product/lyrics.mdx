  <Accordion title="Structure Your Lyrics">
    Use section headers like [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge] to help readers follow along.

  <Accordion title="Keep Formatting Clean">
    Avoid excessive spacing or unusual characters that may display poorly.

  <Accordion title="Label Instrumentals">
    For beats without vocals, add "[Instrumental]" so users know lyrics aren't missing.
