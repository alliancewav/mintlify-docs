    - Audio quality meets standards
    - No duplicate fingerprints detected
    - Metadata is complete
  </Step>

    Your beat goes live and is:
    - Visible in the catalog

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Release States

Beats can exist in different states:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Draft">
    **Not visible to others**
    
    Incomplete uploads or works in progress. Return to complete and publish.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Published">
    **Fully visible and available**
    
    Live in the catalog, available for streaming and licensing.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Archived">
    **Hidden from public**
    
    Not visible in catalog or search, but historical data preserved. Can be republished.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Exclusive Sold">
    **Removed after exclusive purchase**
    
    No longer available for licensing. May remain for streaming depending on license terms.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Managing Release State

From **Backstage > Tracks**:

- **Publish Draft**: Complete metadata and go live
- **Archive**: Hide from catalog without deleting
- **Republish**: Make archived track visible again
- **Delete**: Permanently remove (use cautiously)

<Warning>
  Deleting a track removes all historical analytics and contribution data permanently.
</Warning>

## Scheduling Releases

Currently, all publishes are immediate. Scheduled release features are planned for future updates.

### Workaround for Timed Releases

1. Complete your upload
2. Save as draft
3. Publish manually at your desired time
4. Promote immediately after publishing

---

## Audio Fingerprinting

Every uploaded beat receives a unique audio fingerprint:

### Purpose

- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents the same beat from being uploaded twice
- **Authenticity**: Verifies original ownership
- **License Verification**: Links licenses to specific audio

### What Happens with Duplicates

If a fingerprint match is detected:

1. Upload is flagged for review
2. You're notified of the match
3. Must verify ownership or acknowledge prior upload

<Note>
  Uploading the same beat to multiple accounts violates platform terms.
</Note>

## Distribution Scope

### Where Your Beats Are Available

BeatPass beats are available:

- On the BeatPass web platform
- Through direct links you share
- In search engine results (public beats)
- Within the platform's mobile experience

### External Distribution

BeatPass does not automatically distribute to:

- Spotify, Apple Music, or streaming platforms

<Tip>
  For broader distribution, consider separate distribution services for finished songs that use your beats.
</Tip>
