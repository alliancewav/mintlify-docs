## Overview

BeatPass delivers high-quality audio for streaming and downloads. This guide covers quality settings, format specifications, and playback behavior.

---

## Streaming Quality Ladder

### Quality Tiers

| Tier | Bitrate | Format | When Used |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Standard** | 128 kbps | AAC | Default streaming |
| **High Quality** | 256 kbps | AAC | HQ mode enabled |
| **Preview** | 128 kbps | AAC + watermark | Unlicensed playback |

<Note>
  Quality selection is automatic based on your settings and network conditions. There's no manual per-track quality selection.
</Note>

### Enabling High Quality

1. Go to **Settings > Playback**
2. Toggle **High Quality Streaming**
3. Save changes

<Tip>
  High Quality streaming uses approximately 2x the data. Consider this on mobile data plans.
</Tip>

## Download Formats

### Licensed Downloads

When you purchase a license, you receive the full-quality audio file:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="All Licenses" icon="file-audio">
    **WAV (Lossless)** — High-quality mixdown file
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  BeatPass delivers WAV files for all licensed downloads. The original lossless quality uploaded by the producer is preserved.
</Note>

### Format Specifications

</CardGroup>

### Stems

<Info>
  BeatPass does not support stem uploads or downloads through the platform. Each track is delivered as a single full mixdown file. If you need stems, contact the producer directly to arrange separate delivery.

## Watermarks & Previews

### How Watermarks Work

| Scenario | Audio |
|----------|-------|
| Browsing (not logged in) | Watermarked preview |
| Browsing (logged in, no license) | Watermarked preview |
| Purchased license | Clean, no watermark |
| Streaming subscription | Clean streaming, no watermark |

### Preview Limitations

- Previews play the full track length but with periodic watermarks
- Watermarks cannot be removed from preview streams
- Watermarks are not present in purchased/licensed downloads

---

## Geographic Restrictions

### Current Policy

<Info>
  **No Geofencing** — BeatPass does not currently implement geographic restrictions (geo-blocking) on content. All tracks are available worldwide.
</Info>

### Future Considerations

If geographic restrictions are implemented in the future:

- Affected tracks would show "Not available in your region"
- VPN use to circumvent restrictions violates Terms of Service
- Documentation will be updated if policies change

---

## DRM Policy

### No DRM on Downloads

<Info>
  **No DRM** — BeatPass does not apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) to downloaded files. Licensed files are delivered without copy protection.
</Info>

This means:

- Downloaded files play on any device/software
- No special player required
- You're responsible for using content per license terms

<Warning>
  The absence of DRM doesn't grant additional rights. Use content only as your license permits. Misuse can result in legal action.
</Warning>

| High Quality | ~2 MB | ~120 MB |

### Reducing Data Usage
