## Overview

Beat Requests connect artists who need specific beats with producers who can create them. Artists describe what they need; producers respond with matching tracks.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Artists (posting) and Producers (responding)
</Info>

## For Artists: Posting Requests

### When to Use Beat Requests

Beat Requests are ideal when:

- You can't find the right beat in the catalog
- You need a custom beat for a specific project
- You want to work directly with a producer
- You have a specific reference track in mind

### Creating a Request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Beat Requests">
    Go to **Beat Requests** from the main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create Request">
    Start a new request form.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Describe Your Needs">
    Be specific about what you're looking for:
    
    - **Title**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Dark Melodic Trap Beat")
    - **Genre**: Primary style (Trap, R&B, Drill, etc.)
    - **BPM Range**: Tempo requirements (e.g., 140-150)
    - **Mood**: Emotional tone (dark, uplifting, aggressive, etc.)
    - **Description**: Detailed explanation of what you need
    - **Reference**: Links to similar tracks for context
    - **Budget**: Optional but helps filter serious producers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Visibility">
    Choose who can see your request:
    - **Public**: All producers can respond
    - **Following Only**: Only producers you follow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit">
    Your request goes live for **24 hours**. All verified producers receive a notification (no genre/budget filtering).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Who gets notified?** When you submit a beat request, **all verified producers** receive an email notification (excluding you). Notifications are broadcast to the entire verified producer pool—there is no filtering by genre or budget.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Can unverified producers see my request?** Yes. Any authenticated producer can browse and respond to active beat requests. Verified status only affects who receives the notification blast—it doesn't restrict visibility.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Beat requests are active for **24 hours** from submission. After expiry, producers can no longer respond.
</Warning>

### Writing Effective Descriptions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do Include">
    - Specific tempo requirements
    - Mood and energy level
    - Instrumentation preferences
    - Reference tracks (links or names)
    - Project context (commercial, mixtape, etc.)
    - Timeline if relevant
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid">
    - Vague descriptions ("something fire")
    - Unrealistic budgets
    - Overly complex requirements
    - Demanding exclusive rights for low budgets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Request

> **Title:** Dark Melodic Trap Beat  
> **Genre:** Trap  
> **BPM:** 140-150  
> **Mood:** Dark, atmospheric, emotional  
> **Description:** Looking for a moody trap beat with heavy 808s and a memorable melody. Something in the style of Metro Boomin or Southside. Need it for an upcoming EP track. Open to exclusive licensing if the beat is right.  
> **Budget:** $200-400 exclusive

## For Producers: Responding to Requests

### Finding Requests

Browse requests that match your style:

1. Go to **Beat Requests** section
2. Filter by genre, budget, or recency
3. Read descriptions carefully
4. Check the artist's profile and history

### Submitting a Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Matching Request">
    Look for requests that align with your catalog or style.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare Your Response">
    Either:
    - Link an existing track from your catalog
    - Create a new beat specifically for the request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Your Response">
    Include a message explaining why your beat fits their needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Feedback">
    The artist will review submissions and may:
    - Accept and purchase
    - Request modifications
    - Pass and continue searching
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Response Best Practices

<Tip>
  Personalize your message. Generic responses like "Check this out" are less effective than explaining why your beat matches their description.
</Tip>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="circle-check">
    - Reference their specific requirements
    - Explain how your beat fits their vision
    - Be open to negotiation
    - Respond promptly (within hours, not days)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't" icon="circle-xmark">
    - Send unrelated beats
    - Copy-paste the same generic message
    - Ignore their budget range
    - Wait days to reply
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Requests

### For Artists

- **Edit**: Update requirements while request is active
- **Expire**: Requests auto-expire after **24 hours** (not editable)
- **Submit New**: Create a new request if the first expires without a match

<Note>
  There is no "close" or "mark as fulfilled" action. Requests simply expire after 24 hours. If you find a beat, proceed directly to licensing—the request status doesn't change.
</Note>

### For Producers

- **Browse Requests**: View all active requests (no notification required)
- **Track Responses**: See which requests you've responded to
- **Follow Up**: Message artists directly for feedback

---

## Request Lifecycle & States

### Request States

Beat requests have only two possible states:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active" icon="clock">
    **Accepting responses** (first 24 hours)
    
    - Artists can edit or wait for responses
    - Producers can submit matching beats
    - All verified producers received notification
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expired" icon="hourglass-end">
    **24 hours passed**
    
    - Artists can create a new request
    - Producers should find other active requests
    - History remains viewable for reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  There are no "Fulfilled" or "Closed" states. Requests are either active (accepting responses) or expired. The `fulfillRequest` method does not change the request status—it only records which response was accepted.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Beat requests expire after 24 hours.** This keeps the marketplace fresh and ensures producers respond to active requests. If you don't find a match, submit a new request.
</Warning>

### Response Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Producer Submits Response">
    Producer links a track and sends message explaining fit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Reviews">
    Artist listens to submissions and evaluates matches.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Artist Contacts Producer">
    If interested, artist messages producer to discuss licensing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase Complete">
    Artist purchases license through normal licensing flow (separate from beat request system).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The beat request system facilitates discovery only. There is no "mark as fulfilled" action—accepting a response records the selection but does not close or change the request status. The request simply expires after 24 hours.
</Warning>

### Auto-Expiry Behavior

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hour 0: Request Goes Live">
    All verified producers receive email notification. Request is immediately visible and accepting responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hours 1-24: Active Period">
    Producers browse and respond. Artists review submissions and can message interested producers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hour 24: Auto-Expiry">
    Request automatically expires. No new responses accepted. Conversations continue via messaging.
  </Step>
  <Step title="After Expiry">
    Create a new request if needed (uses available tokens). Old request remains in history for reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **No reminder notifications are sent.** The 24-hour window is enforced by `BeatRequestService::EXPIRY_HOURS = 24`. Expired requests remain in your history for reference but cannot be reopened or extended.
</Note>

### Visibility After Expiry

## Rate Limits & Throttling

Beat requests are subject to rate limiting to prevent spam and ensure fair access.

### Monthly Token Limits

Beat request tokens control how many requests you can submit per month. The number of tokens you receive depends on your subscription plan and may change over time.

<Info>
  Token limits vary by subscription tier. Check your account settings to see your current token allocation and reset date. Tokens reset on the **reset date** shown in your account (typically once per calendar month, UTC)**. Unused tokens do not carry over.
</Info>

### Check Your Status

You can check your current rate limit status:

```http
GET /api/v1/beat-requests/user/rate-limit-status
```

Returns (example):
- Total requests submitted this period
- Your monthly request limit (tokens)
- Tokens remaining
- Reset date for your quota

<Note>
  Beat requests are limited by a **monthly submission quota**, not a concurrent "active requests" cap. Deleting or expiring a request does not restore tokens; your quota refreshes on the reset date shown in your account.
</Note>

---

## Your Beat Requests (Library)

All your submitted beat requests are accessible from your Library:

### Accessing Your Requests

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Library">
    Click **Library** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Beat Requests">
    Choose **Beat requests** from the library menu, or navigate directly to `/library/custom-requests`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View and Manage">
    See all your active and past beat requests in one place.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Request Card Information

Each request card displays:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Content" icon="align-left">
    Your description of what you're looking for
  </Card>
  <Card title="Genre" icon="music">
    Primary genre requested
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mood" icon="face-smile">
    Emotional tone specified
  </Card>
  <Card title="BPM Range" icon="gauge">
    Tempo requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key/Scale" icon="piano-keyboard">
    Musical key preferences (if set)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Budget" icon="dollar-sign">
    Budget range (if specified)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Track" icon="link">
    Link to similar track (if provided)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Status" icon="circle-info">
    Active or Expired
  </Card>
  <Card title="Responses" icon="comments">
    Number of producer responses
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing Your Requests

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Delete Request" icon="trash">
    Remove a request you no longer need. Deleting a request can refund the token used (up to your plans monthly token limit), letting you reuse that slot for a new request.
  </Card>
  <Card title="View Responses" icon="reply">
    See all producer responses with their submitted tracks and messages.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Token Usage**  Each request you submit consumes a token from your monthly allocation. Deleting a request can refund that token (up to your plans monthly token limit), but requests that simply expire after 24 hours do **not** refund tokens. Your tokens refresh on the reset date shown in your account.
</Tip>

### Token Status Display

The library page shows your current token status:

- **Tokens Used**: How many requests you've submitted this month
- **Tokens Remaining**: How many more requests you can submit
- **Reset Date**: When your tokens refresh (according to the reset date shown in your account, typically once per calendar month, UTC)
