## Overview

On BeatPass, **Collections** are how we present **albums**: curated releases of beats from one or more producers.
They are tied to artists, have a fixed tracklist defined by the creators, and power carousels and discovery experiences across the platform.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Listeners and producers  
  **Create/edit:** Only producers (via album upload & edit tools). Listeners can save and play collections but can't change their contents.
</Info>

## Types of Collections

### Your Collections (Liked Albums)

When you like an album, it becomes part of **your collections**:

- Appears in **Library → Albums** as “Your favorite collections”.
- Lets you quickly reopen the album page and play all tracks.
- Does **not** change the album for other users.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Like an album** | Adds the collection to your library |
| **Unlike an album** | Removes it from your library (album itself remains available) |

### Featured Collections

BeatPass highlights selected albums as featured collections in:

- Home page carousels
- Discovery sections
- Genre or mood-based channels

<Note>
  Featured collections are curated by BeatPass using editorial choices and platform analytics. They can't be created or edited directly by listeners.
</Note>

## How Collections Are Created

Collections are created when producers upload and manage **albums**.

### For Producers

Albums are created via the upload/backstage tools:

1. Upload beats as tracks.
2. Group tracks into an album.
3. Set album name, cover art, release date, genres, and tags.
4. Publish the album to make it available on BeatPass.

Under the hood, albums are stored as `Album` records with related `Track`, `Artist`, `Tag`, and `Genre` data. 
The platform surfaces these albums as “collections” in:

- Artist discography panels
- Library → Albums
- Collection carousels (featured/recommended)

### For Listeners

Listeners **do not** create new collection objects directly. Instead, you:

- Discover collections via home, search, channels, and artist pages.
- Like collections (albums) you enjoy to keep them in your library.
- Use **playlists** to create your own flexible, cross-album groupings of tracks.

## Working With Collections

### What You Can and Can't Change

As a **listener**:

- You **can**:
  - Like or unlike collections.
  - Play the full collection or individual tracks.
  - Add tracks from a collection into your own playlists.
- You **cannot**:
  - Change the collection track order.
  - Remove or add tracks directly to a collection.
  - Edit the collection’s name, image, or description.

As a **producer/album owner**:

- You can edit album metadata and tracklist via the album editor:
  - Change track order (track `number`).
  - Add or remove tracks from the album.
  - Update artwork, description, and tags.
- Deleting an album removes the collection and its tracks from discovery for all users.

<Warning>
  Deleting a collection (album) is permanent for listeners.  
  Saved references (likes, library entries) will no longer be playable because the underlying album and its tracks are removed.
</Warning>

## Discovering Collections

## Collections vs Playlists

| Feature | Collections (Albums) | Playlists |
|---------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Source** | Created and owned by producers as album releases | Created by listeners or curators |
| **Contents** | Fixed tracklist defined by the creator | Any tracks from any albums |
| **Editing** | Only album owners/linked artists can edit | Owner and invited editors (on collaborative playlists) can edit |
| **Visibility** | Public, appear in artist pages, search, and carousels | Private or public; public playlists may show up in search and library views |
| **Collaboration** | No collaboration; tracklist controlled by the creator | Optional collaboration via invites on collaborative playlists |
| **Use case** | Canonical releases, discography, catalog organization | Personal or team curation, project buckets, mood/genre mixes |

If you want to **change track order or mix tracks from multiple producers**, use a **playlist** instead of a collection.

## API Access (Albums as Collections)

Collections map to **albums** in the API.

## Best Practices

### For Producers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive collection titles">

  <Accordion title="Write helpful descriptions">
    Explain the story, genre, mood, and ideal use cases for the collection.

  <Accordion title="Keep metadata clean">
    Accurate genres, tags, and artwork improve discovery and recommendations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update rather than duplicate">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### For Listeners
