## Understanding Your License

When you download a beat with Classic, you receive a **non-exclusive license**. Here's what that means:

| What You Can Do | What You Cannot Do |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Release on all streaming platforms | Register the beat with Content ID |
| Monetize your song on YouTube | Claim the beat as your exclusive property |
| Perform live (up to 50 attendees) | Resell or sublicense the beat |
| Distribute worldwide | Remove attribution requirements |

<Info>
**Attribution Required**: You must credit the producer (e.g., "Produced by [Producer Name]") on releases using non-exclusive licenses.
