# Plus Plan — $45 CAD/month

The Plus plan builds on Classic with more custom beat requests. It's designed for active creators who want flexibility without going all-in on Pro.

## What's Included

Plus includes **everything in Classic**, plus these additional benefits:

## Who Is Plus For?

Plus is ideal if you're:

- **Releasing regularly** and need custom beats more often
- **Working on specific projects** that require tailored production
- **Creating more content** and want extra flexibility each month
- **Not ready for Pro** but want more than Classic offers

## Custom Beat Requests Explained

With 3 requests per month, you can describe exactly what you need:

1. **Submit your request** — Specify genre, BPM, mood, reference tracks, and any special requirements
2. **Producers respond** — Matching producers submit beats tailored to your specifications
3. **Review submissions** — Listen to what comes in and choose the beat that fits
4. **Download with full rights** — The beat you select is included in your subscription with full commercial licensing

Unused requests do not roll over to the next month.

## Upgrading or Downgrading

### Upgrade to Pro

Need even more custom requests and priority support? Upgrade to Pro:

1. Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation
2. Select **Billing** from the menu

### Downgrade to Classic

If Plus is more than you need, you can switch to Classic:
