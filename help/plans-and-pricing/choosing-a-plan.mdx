- **Explorer** lets you discover and save beats without cost
- **Classic** adds unlimited downloads when you're ready to release your first tracks

### Independent Artist

**Recommended: Classic ($29/mo) or Plus ($45/mo)**

If you release music regularly on streaming platforms:

- **Classic** provides unlimited downloads and commercial licensing for consistent releases
- **Plus** adds more custom requests if you want tailored beats for specific projects

### Professional or Signed Artist

**Recommended: Pro ($59/mo)**

If music is your career or you're working with a team:

- Maximum custom requests for album or EP production
- Priority support for time-sensitive projects
- Studio discounts to reduce production costs

## Understanding the Value

### Cost Per Beat Comparison

Traditional beat licensing can cost $20-200+ per non-exclusive license. Here's how BeatPass subscriptions compare:

| Releases/Month | Traditional Cost | Classic Cost | Plus Cost | Pro Cost |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 2 beats | $40-400+ | $29 | $45 | $59 |
| 5 beats | $100-1000+ | $29 | $45 | $59 |
| 10 beats | $200-2000+ | $29 | $45 | $59 |
| Unlimited | Impossible | $29 | $45 | $59 |

<Info>
All paid plans include **unlimited downloads**—the more you create, the more value you get from your subscription.

## Common Questions

### Can I switch plans later?

Yes. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time:

- **Upgrades** take effect immediately
- **Downgrades** take effect at your next billing cycle

### What happens to my beats if I cancel?

All beats you downloaded during your subscription remain licensed forever. You can continue releasing and monetizing those songs even after canceling.

### Is there a contract or commitment?

No. All plans are month-to-month with no long-term contracts. Cancel anytime without fees.

### Can I try a paid plan before committing?

Start with **Explorer** (free) to explore the catalog and features. When you're ready, upgrade to any paid plan—if it's not right for you, downgrade or cancel before your next billing cycle.
