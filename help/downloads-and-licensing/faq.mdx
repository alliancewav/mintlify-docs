## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a subscription to download beats?">
    Yes. To download beats with a non-exclusive license, you need an active BeatPass subscription **and** download permission. Producers downloading their own tracks can download without generating a license. The only exception to subscription is purchasing an exclusive license, which is a one-time payment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What file formats do I receive?">
    **Non-exclusive downloads:** WAV and MP3 (320kbps)
    
    **Exclusive purchases:** WAV, WAV tagged, MP3 (320kbps), and stems (if available)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I download unlimited beats?">
    Yes, with an active subscription you can download unlimited beats. Each download grants a non-exclusive license for that track.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are downloads permanent?">
    Yes. Your license is perpetual, meaning it never expires. Even if you cancel your subscription, you keep all licenses obtained while subscribed.
  </Accordion>

## License Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between exclusive and non-exclusive?">
    **Non-exclusive:** Multiple artists can license the same beat. You have usage rights but don't own the beat. Attribution required. Limited to 50 attendees for performances.
    
    **Exclusive:** Only you own the beat. Full rights including sync licensing, unlimited performances, Content ID registration, and stems.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I have to credit the producer?">
    **Non-exclusive:** Yes. You must credit "Produced by [Producer Name]" wherever your song is shared.
    
    **Exclusive:** Attribution requirements depend on the specific license terms set by the producer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use beats in YouTube videos?">
    Yes. Both non-exclusive and exclusive licenses allow monetized YouTube videos. However, only exclusive licenses allow Content ID registration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use beats in movies, TV, or commercials?">
    **Non-exclusive:** No. Sync licensing for film/TV/commercials requires an exclusive license or license upgrade.
    
    **Exclusive:** Yes. Full sync rights are included.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does 'perpetual' license mean?">
    A perpetual license never expires. Your right to use the beat remains valid forever, even if the beat is removed from BeatPass or you cancel your subscription.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer my license to someone else?">
    No. Licenses are non-transferable and tied to your specific user account. You cannot sell, share, or give your license to another person.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Exclusive License Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I buy exclusive rights?">
    1. You make a one-time payment via Stripe
    2. An exclusive license certificate is generated
    3. The track is marked as "SOLD" and removed from non-exclusive downloads (exclusive-only tracks never offer non-exclusive)
    4. You receive WAV, MP3, and stems
    5. No one else can license this beat
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I buy exclusive if someone already has non-exclusive?">
    Yes, you can still purchase exclusive rights. Existing non-exclusive licenses remain valid, but no new non-exclusive licenses will be issued.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I get publishing rights with exclusive?">
    The default split is 20% producer / 80% licensee. Specific terms vary by producer and may be customized in the license.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if a beat I want is already sold exclusively?">
    If a beat shows "SOLD" status, it's no longer available. The exclusive owner has full rights, and it cannot be licensed by anyone else.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Certificate Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a license certificate?">
    A license certificate is a legal document that proves your right to use a beat. It contains track details, your information, usage terms, and cryptographic verification.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I access my license certificate?">
    1. Go to the track page for any beat you've downloaded
    2. Click "Get License" or "View License"
    3. Download as PDF if needed
    
    Or visit your Library → Licenses to see all your certificates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I verify if a license is real?">
    Yes. Every certificate has a verification URL. Visit `/verify-license/{uuid}` to check if a license exists and is valid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my license shows 'revoked'?">
    A revoked license means your usage rights have been terminated. This may happen due to terms violation, refund, or administrative action. Contact support for details.
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is BeatPassID / audio fingerprinting?">
    BeatPassID is the acoustic fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature for each track. This links your license to the specific audio and enables verification.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why does my download show 'pending fingerprint'?">
    New tracks are queued for fingerprinting after upload. Downloads are blocked until fingerprinting is completed. This usually completes within minutes; if it stays pending, the download remains unavailable until finished.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can the producer see who downloaded their beat?">
    Yes. Producers receive notifications when their beats are downloaded (based on their notification preferences) and can see download statistics in their analytics.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my information private on the license?">
    Your email is masked on verification pages (e.g., j****n@email.com). Your full information plus the device/browser/IP snapshot captured at issuance is only visible on your own license certificate.
  </Accordion>
