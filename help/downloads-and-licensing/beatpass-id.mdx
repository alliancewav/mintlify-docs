## What is BeatPassID?

BeatPassID is BeatPass's acoustic audio fingerprinting system that creates a unique digital signature for every track. This cryptographic fingerprint uniquely identifies the audio content and cannot be forged or duplicated.

<Info>
  BeatPassID technology protects both creators and licensees by providing verifiable proof of licensing.

## How Audio Fingerprinting Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio Analysis">
    When a track is uploaded, the system analyzes the audio waveform using acoustic fingerprinting algorithms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hash Generation">
    A unique SHA-256 cryptographic hash is generated from the audio's acoustic characteristics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permanent Storage">
    The fingerprint hash is stored in a dedicated database alongside track metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="License Linking">
    When you download a track, your license certificate includes the fingerprint hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fingerprint Data

Each BeatPassID record contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Track ID** | Reference to the original track |
| **Track Name** | Permanent snapshot of track name at fingerprint time |
| **Artist Names** | Array of credited artists |
| **Fingerprint Hash** | Unique SHA-256 cryptographic hash |
| **Duration** | Analyzed audio duration in seconds |
| **Status** | `pending`, `completed`, or `failed` |
| **Fingerprinted At** | Timestamp when fingerprint was generated |

---

## Fingerprint Status

### Completed

The track has been successfully fingerprinted and is ready for licensing.

- Fingerprint hash is generated
- License certificates can be issued
- Verification is enabled

### Pending

The track is queued for fingerprinting.

- Upload is complete
- Audio analysis is in progress
- Downloads may be temporarily unavailable

### Failed

Fingerprinting could not be completed.

- Error message is logged
- May indicate audio quality issues
- Admin review may be required

<Warning>
  Tracks without a completed fingerprint cannot have license certificates generated. If you see a fingerprint error, contact support.
</Warning>

## How BeatPassID Protects You

### For Licensees (Beat Users)

- **Proof of License** — Your license certificate includes the fingerprint hash, proving you licensed the specific audio
- **Verification** — Anyone can verify your license is authentic using the verification URL
- **Legal Protection** — Cryptographic proof links your license to the exact audio content

### For Producers (Beat Creators)

- **Duplicate Detection** — Prevents the same audio from being uploaded multiple times
- **Audit Trail** — Complete record of all licenses issued for your tracks
- **Ownership Proof** — Fingerprint establishes you as the original uploader

## Viewing Fingerprint Information

### On License Certificates

Your license certificate displays:

```
Audio Fingerprint Details
─────────────────────────
Fingerprint Status: COMPLETED & VERIFIED
Fingerprinted On: [Date]
Analyzed Duration: [X] seconds
Certificate ID: [UUID]

Complete Audio Fingerprint Hash:
[64-character SHA-256 hash]
```

### In Producer Dashboard

Producers can view fingerprint status for their tracks in the upload interface and track management areas.

---

## Duplicate Detection

BeatPassID automatically detects duplicate uploads:

1. When you upload a track, the fingerprint hash is calculated
2. System checks if the same hash already exists
3. If found, you're notified of the duplicate
4. This prevents accidental re-uploads and copyright conflicts

---

## Technical Details

### Hash Algorithm

BeatPassID uses **SHA-256** cryptographic hashing:

- 256-bit output (64 hexadecimal characters)
- Collision-resistant (virtually impossible to forge)
- One-way function (cannot reverse-engineer original audio)

### Storage

Fingerprints are stored in a dedicated database:

- Separate from main application data
- Optimized for fast hash lookups
- Includes metadata snapshots for permanence

### Verification

License certificates include:

- **Certificate Hash** — SHA-256 of license data for integrity
- **Cryptographic Signature** — HMAC-SHA256 signature for authenticity
- **Fingerprint Hash** — Links certificate to specific audio

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does my track say 'Pending Fingerprint'?">
    New uploads are queued for fingerprinting. This usually completes within minutes. If it stays pending for more than an hour, contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can fingerprints be faked?">
    No. Fingerprints are generated server-side using the actual audio file. They cannot be forged or manipulated by users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my fingerprint shows 'Failed'?">
    This may indicate an issue with the audio file (corrupted, too short, or unsupported format). Try re-uploading or contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does fingerprinting affect audio quality?">
    No. Fingerprinting is a read-only analysis. It does not modify your audio files in any way.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long is fingerprint data stored?">
    Fingerprint data is stored permanently to support license verification even after tracks are removed from the platform.
  </Accordion>
