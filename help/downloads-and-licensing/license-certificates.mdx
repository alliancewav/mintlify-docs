## What is a License Certificate?

A license certificate is a legal document that proves your right to use a beat from BeatPass. It contains a permanent snapshot of the track details, your user information, and the specific terms under which you can use the beat.

<Info>
  Your license certificate is generated automatically when you download a beat and is stored permanently in the BeatPass database.
