## Overview

Downloading a beat on BeatPass automatically generates a license certificate that grants you usage rights. The download process is designed to be seamless while ensuring proper licensing.

<Info>
  **Requirements:** You need an active BeatPass subscription **and** the ability to download tracks. Subscribers receive non-exclusive licenses; artists downloading their own tracks can download without generating a license.
</Info>

## Download Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Track">
    Browse the catalog and find a beat you want to download. Click the **Download** button on the track page or player.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Permission & Subscription Check">
    BeatPass confirms you have download rights (active subscription and permission). Artists on their own tracks can download even without a generated license.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fingerprint Verification">
    The system verifies the track has a completed audio fingerprint. This is required for license generation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="License Check">
    BeatPass checks if you already have a license for this track. If so, it retrieves your existing license.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="License Generation">
    If you don't have a license, a new license certificate is automatically generated with:
    - Your user information
    - Track details and fingerprint hash
    - License terms and permissions
    - Cryptographic signature
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Download">
    The audio file is downloaded to your device in your selected format.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notifications">
    - You receive a confirmation of your license
    - The producer is notified of the download (based on their notification preferences)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### License Certificate Generation

When you download, BeatPass automatically creates a license certificate that captures:

**Track Information:**
- Beat name and producer credits
- Audio fingerprint (BeatPassID)
- Duration and genre

**Your Information:**
- Your name and account details
- License issue date

**Security Features:**
- Unique certificate ID
- Cryptographic signature for authenticity
- Verification hash for tampering protection

This information is permanently stored so your license remains valid even if the track details change later.

### Download Tracking

BeatPass records each download to:
- Generate accurate play and download statistics for producers
- Maintain audit trails for license verification
- Improve recommendations based on listening habits

---

## Downloading Your Own Tracks

If you're the **producer** downloading your own track:

- No license is generated (you already own it)
- Download proceeds normally
- No notifications are sent
- Download statistics are still recorded

<Note>
  BeatPass automatically recognizes when you're downloading your own tracks and skips the licensing step.
</Note>
