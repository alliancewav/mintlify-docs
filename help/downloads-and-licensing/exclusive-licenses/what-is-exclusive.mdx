## Understanding Exclusive Licensing

An **exclusive license** means only one person can own usage rights to a beat. When you purchase a beat exclusively, no one else can license it—it becomes exclusively yours.

<Info>
  Think of it like buying a house versus renting an apartment. Non-exclusive is like renting (others can rent too), while exclusive is like buying (you're the only owner).
</Info>

## What "Exclusive" Actually Means

### You Get

- **Sole ownership rights** — No one else can license this beat
- **Full creative control** — Use it however you want
- **Sync licensing** — Use in movies, TV, commercials
- **Broadcasting** — Radio, TV, unlimited stations
- **Content ID** — Register for YouTube Content ID
- **Stems** — Individual instrument tracks for remixing
- **Unlimited performances** — Any venue size

### Track Status Changes

When purchased exclusively:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Status: Available | Status: **SOLD** |
| Others can download | Downloads **blocked** |
| Non-exclusive active | No new licenses |

## Ownership vs Usage Rights

### Non-Exclusive (Usage Rights)

With a non-exclusive license, you have:
- Permission to **use** the beat
- No ownership of the beat itself
- Shared with other licensees
- Restrictions on certain uses

### Exclusive (Ownership Rights)

With an exclusive license, you have:
- Full **ownership** of the beat rights
- The beat is yours alone
- Complete control over usage
- No significant restrictions

---

## Publishing Rights

Exclusive licenses typically include publishing arrangements:

| Party | Default Share |
|-------|---------------|
| **Producer** | 20% |
| **Licensee (You)** | 80% |

This means:
- You collect 80% of publishing royalties
- Producer retains 20% as the original composer
- These percentages may be customized by the producer

<Note>
  Publishing rights affect royalty collection from performance, mechanical, and sync royalties. Register your songs with a PRO (ASCAP, BMI, etc.) to collect.
</Note>

## What Happens to Existing Licenses

If others downloaded the beat with non-exclusive licenses before your purchase:

- **Their licenses remain valid** — They can keep using it
- **No new licenses issued** — No one new can download
- **You still have exclusive going forward** — You're the only one who can license it now

<Warning>
  Exclusive doesn't mean you're the only one who ever used the beat—it means you're the only one going forward. Check play counts to see how many have licensed it non-exclusively.
</Warning>

## Exclusive-Only Tracks

Some producers list tracks as **exclusive-only**:

- No non-exclusive option available
- Track is marked for exclusive purchase only
- Must purchase exclusive to use
- Often higher-value or premium beats

---

## When to Buy Exclusive

Consider exclusive if:

- You want to be the only artist using this beat
- You need sync licensing for film/TV
- You want to register for Content ID
- You plan major commercial releases
- The beat is central to your brand

Non-exclusive may be fine if:

- You're still experimenting
- Budget is limited
- You don't need sync rights
- Sharing with others doesn't concern you
