## Overview

An exclusive license grants you **full ownership rights** to a beat. Once purchased exclusively, no one else can license that beat, and you receive complete usage rights including sync licensing, stems, and Content ID registration.

<Info>
  Exclusive licenses are one-time purchases, separate from subscription plans.
