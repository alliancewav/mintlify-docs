You've found the perfect beat and downloaded it with a license. Now what? This guide walks you through releasing your finished song on streaming platforms using a BeatPass-licensed beat.

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- An active BeatPass subscription (or an exclusive license purchase)
- The beat downloaded to your device
- Your **license certificate** accessible in **Library** → **My Licenses**

<Tip>
  Keep your license certificate saved — you may need it to resolve Content ID claims or prove your usage rights to distributors.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Release Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record your song">
    Use the downloaded WAV file as the instrumental for your recording. Record your vocals or additional elements over the beat in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mix and master">
    Mix your vocals with the beat and master the final track. Export your finished song as a WAV or high-quality MP3 file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credit the producer">
    **Non-exclusive licenses require attribution.** Include the producer credit wherever your song appears:

    - **Song title or description**: "Produced by [Producer Name]"
    - **Streaming metadata**: Add the producer in the "Producer" or "Composer" field
    - **Social media posts**: Tag or mention the producer when sharing

    <Note>
      Exclusive license attribution requirements depend on the specific terms set by the producer. Check your license certificate for details.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a distributor">
    To get your song on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and other platforms, you need a music distributor. Popular options include:

    - **DistroKid**
    - **TuneCore**
    - **CD Baby**
    - **Amuse**
    - **UnitedMasters**

    Each distributor has different pricing and features — choose one that fits your needs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload to your distributor">
    When uploading, you'll typically need:

    - Your finished audio file (WAV recommended)
    - Cover art (at least 3000 x 3000 px, JPG or PNG)
    - Song title, artist name, and genre
    - **Producer credit** in the composer/producer metadata fields
    - Release date (schedule in advance for playlist consideration)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle Content ID (if applicable)">
    Some beats on BeatPass may be registered with Content ID systems. If you receive a claim after releasing:

    1. Don't panic — this is common and resolvable
    2. Use your license certificate to dispute the claim
    3. See our [Content ID & Copyright Claims](/help/downloads-and-licensing/content-id-claims) guide for detailed steps

    <Info>
      Only **exclusive licenses** allow you to register your own Content ID. With a non-exclusive license, you cannot register Content ID but you can dispute claims against your release.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Promote your release">
    Share your song on social media, submit to playlists, and let your audience know. Tag the producer to build the relationship and increase visibility for both of you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to send the producer a copy of my song?">
    It's not required, but it's a nice gesture. Many producers appreciate hearing what artists create with their beats.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I release on multiple platforms?">
    Yes. Your license covers distribution across all major streaming platforms, social media, and your own website.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my distributor asks for proof of license?">
    Provide your BeatPass license certificate. It contains track details, your information, license terms, and a verification URL that anyone can check.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change the beat (chop, rearrange, add elements)?">
    Yes. You can modify the beat for your song — add elements, rearrange sections, or adjust the mix. The license covers derivative works created for your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many songs can I make with one download?">
    Each non-exclusive download grants a license for **one project** (one song). If you want to use the same beat for a different song, download it again to generate a new license.
  </Accordion>
