If you release a song using a BeatPass-licensed beat and receive a Content ID claim or copyright notice, don't panic. This is a common occurrence and is usually resolved quickly with your license certificate.

---

## Why Claims Happen

Content ID systems on YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms automatically scan uploaded audio against a database of registered content. A claim can be triggered when:

- The **producer** or a third party has registered the instrumental with a Content ID service
- Another artist released a song using the same beat (common with non-exclusive licenses)
- A distribution service automatically fingerprints and registers content

<Info>
  A Content ID claim is **not** the same as a copyright strike. Claims are automated matches — they don't penalize your account. You have the right to dispute them with proof of your license.

## How to Resolve a Claim

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the claim">
    Check where the claim appeared:

    - **YouTube**: Go to **YouTube Studio** → **Content** → look for a copyright claim icon next to your video
    - **Spotify/Apple Music**: Your distributor will notify you via email if there's a takedown request
    - **Other platforms**: Check your platform's content or copyright notifications area
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your license certificate">
    Go to your BeatPass **Library** → **My Licenses** and find the license for the beat in question. You can also:

    - Search by track name in your library
    - Download the certificate as a PDF
    - Copy the **verification URL** from the certificate
  </Step>

  <Step title="File a dispute">
    Use the platform's dispute process and provide your license information:

    **For YouTube:**
    1. In YouTube Studio, click on the claim
    2. Select **Actions** → **Dispute**
    3. Choose **License** as the reason
    4. Include in your explanation:
       - "I have a valid non-exclusive/exclusive license from BeatPass for this beat"
       - Your license certificate ID
       - The verification URL from your certificate (e.g., `open.beatpass.ca/verify-license/[your-uuid]`)

    **For distributors (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.):**
    1. Reply to the takedown notification from your distributor
    2. Attach your license certificate PDF
    3. Include the verification URL so they can confirm your license independently
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for resolution">
    Most disputes are resolved within **7–30 days** depending on the platform. During this time:

    - **YouTube**: Your video usually stays live, but revenue may be held until resolved
    - **Streaming platforms**: Your distributor handles the counter-notification process
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Your License Certificate Proves

Your BeatPass license certificate is your proof of rights. It includes:

| Field | What It Proves |
|-------|---------------|
| **License ID** | Unique identifier for your specific license |
| **Track information** | The exact beat you licensed, with title and producer |
| **BeatPassID fingerprint** | Acoustic match to the specific audio file |
| **License type** | Non-exclusive or exclusive, with usage terms |
| **Verification URL** | A public URL anyone can visit to confirm the license is valid and active |
| **Issue date** | When the license was granted |

<Tip>
  The verification URL is your strongest tool. Platforms and claimants can visit it to independently confirm your license exists and is active — no back-and-forth needed.
</Tip>

## Non-Exclusive vs. Exclusive: Content ID Differences

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Non-Exclusive License" icon="users">
    - You **cannot** register Content ID for the beat
    - You **can** dispute claims against your release using your license
    - Multiple artists may have claims on the same beat — this is normal
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exclusive License" icon="crown">
    - You **can** register Content ID for the beat
    - You have full rights to the audio, so claims should not occur
    - If they do, dispute with your exclusive license certificate

## Preventing Future Claims

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always keep your license certificates">
    Download PDFs and store them alongside your project files. You may need them months or years after release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add producer credits in your metadata">
    Proper attribution in your song's metadata (producer, composer fields) can help platforms recognize the relationship and reduce false claims.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider exclusive licenses for major releases">
    If a song is a lead single or likely to get significant streams, an exclusive license gives you full rights including Content ID registration, eliminating most claim issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate with your distributor">
    Some distributors have pre-clearance processes. Let them know you're using a licensed beat and provide the certificate proactively.
