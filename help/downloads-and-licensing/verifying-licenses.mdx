## Security Information

The verification page displays security details:

### Encryption

- **256-bit SSL** — All verification requests are encrypted

### Fingerprinted

- **Audio verified** — License is linked to acoustic fingerprint

### Database Verification

- **VERIFIED** — License exists in BeatPass database
- **NOT FOUND** — License does not exist

---

## Verification Count

Each verification attempt is logged:

- **Counter increments** with each verification
- **Last verified timestamp** is recorded
- **IP address** of verifier is logged (for security)

This creates an audit trail showing how often a license has been checked.

## Verification from Certificate

On every license certificate, there's a verification section:

```
VERIFICATION
This license can be verified at:
https://open.beatpass.ca/verify-license/{uuid}

The verification link above checks the license validity 
in the BeatPass database. If the license is not found or has been 
revoked, it will be marked as invalid.
```

<Tip>
  For programmatic license verification, see the [API Reference](/developers/api-reference) for technical details.
