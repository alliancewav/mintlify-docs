## Requirements

### Current Password

You must enter your current password to change it. This security measure ensures that only you can update your password.

<Note>
  If you don't have a password set (because you signed up with social login), the process may be different. You might need to verify via email first.
</Note>

### New Password Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Minimum length** | 5 characters |
| **Confirmation** | Must match in both fields |

## What Happens After

When you successfully change your password:

- **Immediate effect** — Your new password works right away
- **Sessions may continue** — Existing logged-in sessions typically remain active
- **Use new password** — Next time you log in, use your new password

<Tip>
  After changing your password, consider logging out of other devices using [Active Sessions](/help/account-settings/active-sessions) for extra security.
</Tip>
