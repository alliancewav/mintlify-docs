## Email Not Arriving?

If you don't receive the password reset email:

### Check These First

- **Spam/Junk folder** — The email may have been filtered
- **Correct email** — Make sure you entered the email linked to your account
- **Wait a few minutes** — Delivery can take up to 10 minutes

### Still Nothing?

- Try requesting a new reset email
- Check if you have email filters blocking BeatPass emails
- Make sure your mailbox isn't full

<Note>
  The reset email comes from BeatPass. Add contact@beatpass.ca to your contacts to prevent filtering.
</Note>

## Reset Link Issues

### Link Expired

Password reset links expire after a limited time for security. If your link has expired:

1. Go back to the login page
2. Request a new password reset
3. Use the new link promptly

### Link Already Used

Each reset link can only be used once. If you've already reset your password with a link, you'll need to request a new one if you need to reset again.

### Link Not Working

If the link doesn't work:

- Make sure you copied the entire link if you pasted it
- Try clicking the link directly from the email
- Request a fresh reset link

## New Password Requirements

When creating your new password:

| Requirement        | Details               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Minimum length** | 5 characters          |
| **Confirmation**   | Must be entered twice |

<Tip>
  Choose a strong password that's different from your previous one and not used on other websites.
</Tip>

## What If I Don't Have Access to My Email?

If you no longer have access to the email address on your account:

1. **Try to recover your email first** — Check with your email provider about account recovery options
2. **Contact support** — If you can't access your email, you may need to verify your identity through other means

<Warning>
  Without access to your account email, password recovery becomes much more difficult. Keep your email address current in your account settings.
</Warning>

## Alternative Login Options

If you connected a social account before losing your password:

- **Google login** — Click "Continue with Google" on the login page
- **Facebook login** — Click "Continue with Facebook"
- **Twitter login** — Click "Continue with Twitter"

Once logged in via social account, you can set a new password in your account settings.
