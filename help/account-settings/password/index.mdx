## Do You Have a Password?

If you created your account using social login (Google, Facebook, or Twitter), you may not have set a password yet.

### Checking Your Status

Your account shows whether you have a password set. If you signed up with social login:
- You can still log in using your connected social account
- You can add a password at any time for additional login options

### Adding a Password

If you don't have a password and want to add one:
1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Password** section (titled "Update password")
3. Since you don't have a current password, you may be prompted to verify via email
4. Create your new password
5. Confirm by entering it again
