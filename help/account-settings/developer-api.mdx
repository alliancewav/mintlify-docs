API access tokens allow authorized users to connect third-party applications, tools, or scripts to their BeatPass account. API access is **invite-only** — it must be granted by the BeatPass team before you can generate tokens.

<Warning>
  API access is not available to all users. You must request access from the BeatPass team. Once approved, the **Developers** section appears in your Account Settings.
</Warning>

---

## What Are API Tokens?

API tokens are like passwords for applications:

- They allow external programs to access your BeatPass account
- Each token has a name so you can identify what it's used for
- Tokens can be deleted without affecting your main password

<Note>
  API tokens are intended for developers and advanced integrations. Most users don't need API access. Contact the BeatPass team if you'd like to request access.
</Note>

## Creating an API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Account Settings">
    Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**, then scroll to the **Developers** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Token">
    Click the button to create a new token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Token">
    Enter a descriptive name (3-100 characters). Examples:
    - "My Desktop App"
    - "Automation Script"
    - "Personal Project"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Token">
    Click **Create** to generate your token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Token">
    **Important:** Copy the token immediately. For security reasons, the full token is only shown once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The complete token is only displayed once when created. Copy and store it securely. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new token.
</Warning>

## Token Security

### Best Practices

- **Keep tokens secret** — Never share tokens publicly or commit them to code repositories
- **Use descriptive names** — Name tokens by their use so you know what to revoke later
- **Revoke unused tokens** — Delete tokens you no longer need
- **Rotate periodically** — Consider creating new tokens and deleting old ones regularly

### What Tokens Can Do

Tokens provide access to your account through the BeatPass API. The specific permissions depend on your account type and the API endpoints used.

## Deleting API Tokens

If you no longer need a token or suspect it's compromised:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Developers** section and find the token in your list
3. Click **Delete** or the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion

### Effects of Deletion

- The token stops working immediately
- Any applications using that token will lose access
- You cannot recover a deleted token (create a new one instead)

<Tip>
  If you're not sure which token an application is using, create a new one with a clear name and update the application, then delete the old tokens.
</Tip>

## Managing Multiple Tokens

You can create multiple tokens for different purposes:

| Token Name | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| "Mobile App" | Your personal mobile integration |
| "Analytics Tool" | Third-party analytics service |
| "Backup Script" | Automated backup program |

This way, if one token is compromised, you can revoke just that one without affecting other integrations.

---

## Token Format

BeatPass API tokens are secure strings. When you create a token, you receive:

- **Token ID** — A public identifier shown in your settings
- **Plain Text Token** — The full secret token (shown only once)

Use the plain text token when configuring applications.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I lost my token. Can I see it again?">
    No. For security, the full token is only shown once when created. You'll need to create a new token.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many tokens can I create?">
    You can create multiple tokens. There's no strict limit, but keep only the tokens you need.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will deleting a token log me out?">
    No. API tokens are separate from your login session. Deleting a token only affects applications using that specific token.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if someone gets my token?">
    Delete the token immediately in your settings. Then create a new one and update any legitimate applications that need access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Documentation

For developers looking to build integrations:

- See the [API Reference](/developers/api-reference) for available endpoints
- Review authentication requirements in [Getting Started](/developers/quickstart)
