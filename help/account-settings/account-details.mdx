## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my email to one that's already in use?">
    No. Each email address can only be associated with one BeatPass account. If you need to consolidate accounts, you'll need to delete one first.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My avatar isn't updating">
    Try clearing your browser cache or refreshing the page. Large images may take a moment to process. If issues persist, try a smaller image.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I have a different display name and artist name?">
    Yes. Your account display name (shown in settings and general activity) is separate from your producer/artist name (shown on tracks and your artist profile).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my old username?">
    When you change your username, the old one becomes available for others to claim. There's no reservation period.
