Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. When enabled, you'll need both your password and a verification code from your phone to log in.

---

## Why Use Two-Factor Authentication?

With 2FA enabled:

- **Extra protection** — Even if someone knows your password, they can't access your account without your phone
- **Prevent unauthorized access** — Protects against password theft and phishing
- **Peace of mind** — Know your account is secured with industry-standard protection

<Tip>
  Enabling 2FA is strongly recommended, especially if you're a producer with uploaded content or have an active subscription.
</Tip>

## How It Works

1. You enter your password as usual
2. BeatPass asks for a verification code
3. You open your authenticator app to get the code
4. Enter the code to complete login

The code changes every 30 seconds, so even if someone sees it, they can't use it later.

## Setting Up 2FA

### What You Need

- An **<Tooltip tip="A mobile app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy) that generates time-based one-time codes for two-factor login.">authenticator app</Tooltip>** on your smartphone:
  - Google Authenticator (iOS/Android)
  - Microsoft Authenticator (iOS/Android)
  - Authy (iOS/Android)
  - 1Password (iOS/Android/Desktop)
  - Any TOTP-compatible app

### Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Account Settings">
    Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**, then scroll to the **Two factor authentication** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Setup">
    Click **Enable** or **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan QR Code">
    Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code displayed on screen.
    
    If you can't scan, you can manually enter the secret key shown below the QR code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Verification Code">
    Your authenticator app will show a 6-digit code. Enter this code to verify setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Recovery Codes">
    You'll receive recovery codes. **Save these in a safe place** — they're your backup if you lose your phone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recovery Codes

<Tooltip tip="One-time backup codes that let you log in if you lose access to your authenticator app. Each code can only be used once.">Recovery codes</Tooltip> are one-time use codes that let you access your account if you lose your phone or authenticator app.

### Saving Recovery Codes

When you enable 2FA, you'll receive recovery codes. Store them safely:
- Write them down and keep in a secure location
- Save in a password manager
- Store in an encrypted file

<Warning>
  Each recovery code can only be used once. If you use all your codes, generate new ones while you still have access to your account.
</Warning>

### Using a Recovery Code

If you can't access your authenticator app:
1. On the 2FA verification screen, look for **"Use recovery code"** option
2. Enter one of your saved recovery codes
3. You'll be logged in and the used code will be invalidated

---

## Logging In with 2FA

Once 2FA is enabled, logging in works like this:

1. Enter your email and password
2. When prompted, open your authenticator app
3. Enter the 6-digit code shown
4. Click **Verify** to complete login

<Note>
  Codes refresh every 30 seconds. If your code doesn't work, wait for a new one and try again. Make sure your phone's time is accurate.
</Note>

---

## Disabling 2FA

To turn off two-factor authentication:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Two factor authentication** section
3. Click **Disable**
4. Confirm with your password or a verification code

<Warning>
  Disabling 2FA removes the extra security layer from your account. Only disable if necessary.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My code isn't working">
    - Make sure your phone's time is set correctly (use automatic time)
    - Wait for a new code to generate (they change every 30 seconds)
    - Verify you're entering the code for the correct account (check the label in your app)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I lost my phone">
    Use one of your recovery codes to log in. Once logged in, disable 2FA, then set it up again with your new device.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I didn't save my recovery codes">
    If you can still log in:
    1. Go to 2FA settings
    2. Disable 2FA
    3. Re-enable it to get new recovery codes
    4. Save them this time!
    
    If you can't log in, contact support for account recovery.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use 2FA on multiple devices?">
    Yes. When you scan the QR code during setup, you can scan it with multiple authenticator apps/devices. The same code will work from any of them.
  </Accordion>
