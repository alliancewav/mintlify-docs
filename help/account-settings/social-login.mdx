Social login lets you sign in to BeatPass using your existing Google, Facebook, or Twitter account. You can also connect these accounts to your existing BeatPass profile for quick access.

BeatPass supports these social login providers:

| Provider | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Google** | Sign in with your Google/Gmail account |

## Creating an Account with Social Login

If you don't have a BeatPass account yet:

1. Go to the **Sign Up** or **Login** page
2. Click **Continue with Google**, **Continue with Facebook**, or **Continue with Twitter**
3. Authorize BeatPass to access your social account
4. Your BeatPass account is created automatically

### What Happens

- BeatPass creates an account using your social profile's email
- Your name and profile picture may be imported
- You can log in using that social account going forward
- You don't need to set a password (but you can add one later)

## Connecting Social Accounts

If you already have a BeatPass account, you can connect social accounts for easier login:

### How to Connect

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Social login** section
3. Find the social provider you want to connect
3. Click **Connect** next to Google, Facebook, or Twitter
4. Authorize BeatPass in the popup window
5. Your accounts are now linked

### Benefits of Connecting

- **Faster login** — Click one button instead of typing password
- **Multiple options** — Log in with email/password OR social account
- **Account recovery** — Alternative way to access your account

<Tip>
  Connecting multiple social accounts gives you backup login options if you lose access to one.
</Tip>

## Disconnecting Social Accounts

To unlink a social account from your BeatPass profile:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Social login** section
3. Find the connected account and click **Disconnect**
4. Confirm the disconnection

### Important Considerations

- **Before disconnecting**, make sure you have another way to log in:
  - A password set on your account, OR
  - Another social account connected
- If you signed up with social login and disconnect without setting a password, you may be locked out

<Warning>
  Don't disconnect your only login method. Either set a password or connect another social account before disconnecting.
</Warning>

## Account Email Matching

When you use social login:

### New Users

If no BeatPass account exists with your social email:
- A new account is created automatically

### Existing Email

If a BeatPass account already exists with that email:
- You'll be asked to verify by entering your BeatPass password
- Once verified, the social account is linked to your existing account

This prevents someone else from accessing your account by using a social account with your email address.

## What BeatPass Accesses

When you connect a social account, BeatPass typically receives:

| Information | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Email address** | Account identification |
| **Name** | Display name (if you don't have one set) |
| **Profile picture** | Avatar (optional) |

BeatPass does **not**:
- Post on your behalf
- Access your messages
- Access your contacts
- Store your social password
