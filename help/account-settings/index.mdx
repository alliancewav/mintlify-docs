## Security Recommendations

To keep your account secure:

- **Use a strong password** — At least 8 characters (recommend 12+), mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Enable two-factor authentication** — Adds an extra verification step
- **Review active sessions** — Check for unfamiliar devices regularly
- **Keep your email current** — Needed for password recovery

<Tip>
  Enable two-factor authentication for maximum account security. It only takes a minute to set up.
</Tip>
