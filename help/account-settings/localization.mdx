Localization settings let you customize how BeatPass displays content based on your language preference and local timezone. These settings affect how dates, times, and interface text appear throughout the platform.

## Available Settings

| Setting | What It Controls |
|---------|------------------|
| **Language** | Interface text, buttons, and messages |
| **Timezone** | How times are displayed to you |

## Changing Your Language

### How to Change

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Location and language** section
3. Find the **Language** dropdown
4. Select your preferred language
5. Save your changes

### What Changes

When you change your language:
- Interface text (buttons, menus, labels) appears in your language
- System messages and notifications use your language
- Help content may be available in your language

<Note>
  User-generated content (track descriptions, comments, messages from other users) remains in the language it was written in—it's not automatically translated.
</Note>

## Setting Your Timezone

### Why Timezone Matters

Your timezone setting affects how times are displayed:
- When tracks were uploaded
- Comment and message timestamps
- Notification times
- Beat request expiration times

### How to Change

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Edit Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Location and language** section
3. Find the **Timezone** dropdown
4. Select your local timezone
5. Save your changes

### Finding Your Timezone

Timezones are typically listed by:
- Region (e.g., America, Europe, Asia)
- Major city (e.g., New York, London, Tokyo)

Select the one closest to your location.

<Tip>
  If you travel frequently, you may want to keep your timezone set to your home location for consistency.
</Tip>

## How Localization Works

### Language Preference

BeatPass stores your language preference and uses it whenever you're logged in. The system respects this setting for:
- Email notifications (when available in your language)
- Interface display
- System-generated content

### Timezone Display

Times are stored in a standard format and converted to your timezone for display. This means:
- A track uploaded at 2 PM in New York shows as 7 PM for someone in London
- Everyone sees the same event, just adjusted for their local time

<Note>
  Not all content may be fully translated in all languages. Some interface elements may appear in English if translations aren't available.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Times still look wrong after changing timezone">
    - Make sure you saved your changes
    - Try logging out and back in
    - Clear your browser cache
    - Verify you selected the correct timezone (check if it matches your current local time)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My language isn't available">
    BeatPass may not support all languages yet. If your preferred language isn't available, the platform defaults to English. Check back later as new languages may be added.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Some text is still in English">
    Not all interface elements may be translated. User-generated content always appears in the language it was written. Only system text is affected by language settings.
  </Accordion>
