# Playlists

Playlists let you organize your favorite beats into custom collections. Create playlists for different moods, projects, or genres—and optionally share them with the community or invite collaborators to build them together.

## What You Can Do with Playlists

- **Create unlimited playlists** — Organize beats by project, mood, genre, or any way you like
- **Add any beat** — Save beats to your playlists as you browse
- **Make them public or private** — Share with everyone or keep them just for you
- **Invite collaborators** — Let others add and remove tracks from your playlists
- **Follow playlists** — Save playlists created by other users to your library

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Playlist">
    Right-click any track and select **Add to playlist** → **New playlist**, or go to your library and click **New playlist**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize and Share">

## Where to Find Your Playlists

Your playlists appear in several places:

- **Library** — All your created and followed playlists in one place
- **Sidebar** — Quick access to your playlists while browsing
- **Add to playlist menu** — When right-clicking any track

## Playlist vs. Queue

| Feature | Playlist | Queue |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Permanent collection | Temporary playback list |
| **Saves automatically** | Yes | No (clears when you close the app) |
| **Can share with others** | Yes (if public) | No |
| **Multiple collaborators** | Yes | No |

<Tip>
Use playlists for beats you want to keep organized long-term. Use the queue for temporary listening sessions.
