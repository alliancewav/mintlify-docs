# Creating Playlists

Create playlists to organize beats for projects, moods, or any purpose. Each playlist can have a custom image, description, and privacy settings.

## Ways to Create a Playlist

### From the Context Menu

The quickest way to create a playlist while browsing:

1. Right-click on any beat (or long-press on mobile)
2. Select **Add to playlist**
3. Click **New playlist** at the top of the list
4. Enter a name for your playlist
5. Click **Create**

The beat is automatically added to your new playlist.

### From Your Library

To create an empty playlist:

1. Go to your **Library**
2. Navigate to the **Playlists** section
3. Click **New playlist**
4. Fill in the playlist details
5. Click **Create**

## Playlist Settings

When creating or editing a playlist, you can customize:

### Name

Give your playlist a descriptive name that helps you remember what it's for. Examples:
- "Summer Vibes 2025"
- "Dark Trap Beats"
- "Album Project - Working"

### Cover Image

Upload a custom image for your playlist:

1. Click the image placeholder
2. Select an image from your device
3. The image appears as your playlist cover

If you don't upload an image, your playlist will show a default cover or a collage of track artwork.

### Description

Add a description to explain what your playlist is about. This is especially useful for public playlists that others might discover.

*"Give your playlist a catchy description."*

### Privacy Setting

Choose who can see your playlist:

- **Public** — Everyone can see and find your playlist
- **Private** — Only you can see this playlist

See [Playlist Privacy](/help/playlists/playlist-privacy) for more details.

### Collaborative Setting

Enable collaboration to let others add tracks:

- **Off** — Only you can add or remove tracks
- **On** — Invited users can add and remove tracks

See [Collaborative Playlists](/help/playlists/collaborative-playlists) for more details.

## After Creating

Once your playlist is created, you can:

- **Add tracks** — Right-click any beat and select your playlist
- **Edit details** — Right-click the playlist and select **Edit**
- **Change privacy** — Toggle between public and private
- **Delete** — Remove the playlist if you no longer need it

## Editing a Playlist

To edit an existing playlist:

1. Right-click on the playlist (or open the playlist and click the menu icon)
2. Select **Edit**
3. Update the name, image, description, or settings
4. Save your changes

<Tip>
Create project-specific playlists when working on new music. Name them clearly so you can easily find the beats you've collected for each project.
