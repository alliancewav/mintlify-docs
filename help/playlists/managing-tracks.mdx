# Managing Tracks in Playlists

Once you've created a playlist, you can add beats, remove ones you no longer want, and organize them to your liking.

## Adding Tracks

### Add a Single Track

1. Find a beat you want to add
2. Right-click on it (or long-press on mobile)
3. Select **Add to playlist**
4. Choose which playlist to add it to

The track is instantly added to your playlist.

### Add While Creating a Playlist

When you select **New playlist** from the "Add to playlist" menu, the track you right-clicked is automatically added to the new playlist after creation.

### Add Multiple Tracks

To add several tracks at once:

1. Go to an album, producer page, or another playlist
2. Right-click to open the context menu
3. Select **Add to playlist**
4. Choose your playlist

All tracks from that source are added to your playlist.

## Removing Tracks

### Remove from Playlist Page

1. Open your playlist
2. Find the track you want to remove
3. Right-click on it (or click the menu icon)
4. Select **Remove from this playlist**

The track is removed immediately.

### Who Can Remove Tracks

- **Playlist owner** — Can always remove any track
- **Collaborative editors** — Can remove tracks if the playlist is collaborative
- **Followers** — Cannot remove tracks (they can only listen)

## Viewing Your Playlist

When you open a playlist, you'll see:

- **Playlist header** — Cover image, name, description, and creator
- **Track list** — All beats in the playlist with artwork, name, and producer
- **Track count** — Total number of tracks in the playlist
- **Play button** — Start playing all tracks in order

## Playing Tracks

### Play the Whole Playlist

Click the main **Play** button on the playlist page to start from the first track and play through in order.

### Play a Specific Track

Click on any track in the list to start playing from that point. The playlist continues from there.

### Shuffle Play

Use the shuffle button to play tracks in random order.

## Track Context Menu

Right-click any track in a playlist to access options:

- **Play** — Start playing this track
- **Add to queue** — Add to your current listening queue
- **Add to playlist** — Add to another playlist
- **Remove from this playlist** — Remove from the current playlist (if you have permission)
- **Go to track** — View the track's page
- **Go to artist** — View the producer's page
- **Copy link** — Copy a link to the track

## Tips for Organizing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create themed playlists">
    Instead of one giant playlist, create several focused ones: "Chill Beats," "Hard Trap," "R&B Vibes," etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use playlists for projects">
    Create a playlist for each song or album you're working on. Add beats you're considering, then narrow down as you make decisions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Save beats as you browse">
    When you hear something you like, immediately add it to a playlist. Don't rely on remembering to find it later.

Changes to playlists are saved automatically. There's no need to manually save after adding or removing tracks.
