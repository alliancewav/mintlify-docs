# Collaborative Playlists

Collaborative playlists let you build collections together with other users. Invite friends, collaborators, or fellow creators to add and remove tracks from a shared playlist.

## What Collaborators Can Do

When you invite someone to a collaborative playlist, they can:

- **Add tracks** — Add any beat to the playlist
- **Remove tracks** — Remove tracks from the playlist
- **View all tracks** — See everything in the playlist

Collaborators **cannot**:

- Delete the entire playlist
- Change playlist settings (name, image, privacy)
- Invite other collaborators
- Remove other collaborators

Only the playlist owner has full control over settings and collaborator management.

## Creating a Collaborative Playlist

### When Creating a New Playlist

1. Click **New playlist** or use the context menu
2. Enter a name for your playlist
3. Turn on the **Collaborative** toggle
4. The description confirms: *"Invite other users to add tracks."*
5. Create the playlist
6. Invite collaborators (see below)

### Making an Existing Playlist Collaborative

1. Right-click your playlist
2. Select **Collaborative** from the menu (a checkmark appears when enabled)
3. The playlist is now collaborative

Or:

1. Right-click and select **Edit**
2. Turn on the **Collaborative** toggle
3. Save your changes

## Inviting Collaborators

After enabling collaboration, you can invite users:

1. Open your playlist
2. Click **Invite** in the Collaborators section
3. Search for users by name
4. Select the users you want to invite
5. Confirm the invitation

Invited users receive a notification and can accept the invitation to join.

## Managing Collaborators

### Viewing Current Collaborators

Open your collaborative playlist to see the **Collaborators** section, which shows:

- All users who can edit the playlist
- Their profile pictures and names

### Removing a Collaborator

As the playlist owner, you can remove collaborators at any time:

1. Open the playlist
2. Go to the Collaborators section
3. Remove the user you want to revoke access from

## Leaving a Collaborative Playlist

If you're a collaborator (not the owner) and want to leave:

1. Click the **Following** button on the playlist
2. Confirm that you want to leave

When you leave a collaborative playlist, you lose editing access. You can still follow it as a regular user if it's public.
