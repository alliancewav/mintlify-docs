# Playlist Privacy

Every playlist on BeatPass can be either public or private. This setting controls who can find and view your playlist.

## Public vs. Private

| Setting | Who Can See It | Appears In Search | Can Be Shared |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Public** | Everyone | Yes | Yes |
| **Private** | Only you | No | No |

### Public Playlists

When a playlist is set to **Public**:

- Anyone can find it through search
- Anyone can view the tracks
- You can share the link with others
- It may appear in recommendations
- Others can follow it to add to their library

### Private Playlists

When a playlist is set to **Private**:

- Only you can see it
- It won't appear in search results
- The link won't work for others
- It's hidden from your public profile

## Setting Privacy When Creating

When you create a new playlist:

1. Fill in the playlist name and other details
2. Look for the **Public** toggle
3. Turn it **on** for public, or leave it **off** for private
4. Create the playlist

The description below the toggle confirms: *"Everyone can see public playlists."*

## Changing Privacy Later

To change an existing playlist's privacy:

### From the Context Menu

1. Right-click on your playlist
2. Select **Make private** or **Make public** (depending on current setting)
3. The change takes effect immediately

### From the Edit Dialog

1. Right-click your playlist and select **Edit**
2. Toggle the **Public** switch
3. Save your changes

## Privacy and Collaborative Playlists

A playlist can be both:

- **Private + Collaborative** — Only you and invited editors can see it
- **Public + Collaborative** — Everyone can see it, but only invited editors can add/remove tracks

<Note>
Changing a public playlist to private will hide it from anyone who was following it. They will lose access until you make it public again.
</Note>

## Who Sees What

| User Type | Public Playlist | Private Playlist |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| You (owner) | Full access | Full access |
| Collaborative editors | Full access | Full access |
| Followers | View and listen | No access |
| Everyone else | View and listen | No access |

## When to Use Each Setting

### Use Public for:

- Playlists you want to share with friends or the community
- Curated collections you're proud of
- Themed playlists others might enjoy

### Use Private for:

- Work-in-progress collections
- Personal project playlists
- Beats you're evaluating but not ready to share

<Tip>
Start with private playlists while you're building them, then switch to public when they're ready to share.
