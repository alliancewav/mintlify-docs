# Following Playlists

When you find a playlist created by someone else that you enjoy, you can follow it to add it to your library. Following gives you quick access without creating a duplicate.

## How to Follow a Playlist

### From the Playlist Page

1. Open a public playlist created by another user
2. Click the **Follow** button (heart icon)
3. The button changes to **Following** to confirm

### From the Context Menu

1. Right-click on a playlist
2. Select **Follow**
3. The playlist is added to your library

## What Following Does

When you follow a playlist:

- It appears in your **Library** under Playlists
- You can access it quickly from your sidebar
- You'll see updates when tracks are added or removed
- The playlist stays synced with the original

## What Following Doesn't Do

Following is different from copying:

- You **cannot** add or remove tracks (unless you're a collaborative editor)
- You **cannot** change the playlist name, image, or description
- Changes made by the owner appear automatically for you

## Unfollowing a Playlist

To stop following a playlist:

### From the Playlist Page

1. Open the playlist you're following
2. Click the **Following** button
3. The button changes back to **Follow**
4. The playlist is removed from your library

### From the Context Menu

1. Right-click on the followed playlist
2. Select **Unfollow**
3. The playlist is removed from your library

## Following vs. Other Relationships

| Your Role | Can View | Can Add/Remove Tracks | Can Edit Details |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Owner** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Collaborator** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Follower** | Yes | No | No |

## Special Case: Collaborative Playlists

If you're invited as a collaborator on someone else's playlist, you automatically follow it with editing privileges. When you leave a collaborative playlist:

1. A confirmation appears explaining what you'll lose
2. If you confirm, you lose editing access
3. If the playlist is public, you can still follow it as a regular follower

## Finding Playlists to Follow

Discover playlists to follow by:

- **Browsing public playlists** — Explore what others have curated
- **Checking producer profiles** — See playlists created by producers you like
- **Following recommendations** — The platform may suggest popular playlists
- **Getting shared links** — Friends can share playlist links with you

## Managing Followed Playlists

All playlists you follow appear in your Library alongside playlists you've created. To tell them apart:

- **Your playlists** — Show your name as the creator
- **Followed playlists** — Show the original creator's name

<Tip>
Follow playlists that are regularly updated to discover new beats without having to search manually.
