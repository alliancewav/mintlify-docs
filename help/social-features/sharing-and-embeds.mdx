</Steps>

### What You Can Share

</Tip>

## Embedding Players

For tracks and albums, you can embed an interactive BeatPass player directly on your website.

<Note>
  Embed functionality is available for **tracks** and **albums** only. Producer profiles and playlists can be shared via links but cannot be embedded.
</Note>

### Getting the Embed Code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Share dialog">
    Click **Share** on any track or album page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to Embed tab">
    Click the **Embed** tab in the share dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview the embed">
    On desktop, you'll see a live **Preview** of how the embedded player will look.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the code">
    The **Embed Code** section shows the iframe code. Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Embed Code Format

The embed code is a standard HTML iframe:

```html
<iframe 
  width="100%" 
  height="174" 
  allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
  src="https://beatpass.ca/track/123/track-name/embed">
</iframe>
```

### Embed Dimensions

| Content Type | Default Height | Width |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **Track** | 174px | 100% (responsive) |
| **Album** | 384px | 100% (responsive) |

<Tip>
  Embeds are responsive by default. They'll adapt to fit their container width while maintaining the correct height.
</Tip>

### Embed Features

Embedded players include:

- **Playback controls** — Play, pause, and skip through the track
- **Waveform display** — Visual representation of the audio
- **Artwork** — Track or album cover art
- **Producer link** — Links back to the producer's page on BeatPass
- **Volume control** — Adjustable audio level

## Where to Use Embeds

### Websites & Blogs

Paste the embed code into your HTML where you want the player to appear:

```html
<article>
  <h2>Check out this beat!</h2>
  <iframe 
    width="100%" 
    height="174" 
    allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
    src="https://beatpass.ca/track/123/track-name/embed">
  </iframe>
  <p>This producer makes amazing beats!</p>
</article>
```

### WordPress

In WordPress, you can:

1. Add a **Custom HTML** block in the block editor
2. Paste the embed code
3. Preview to see the player

### Social Media

Most social platforms don't support iframe embeds, but they will display a rich preview when you share a BeatPass link. The preview typically includes:

- Track or album artwork
- Title and producer name
- Link to BeatPass

---

## Browser Compatibility

Embedded players work in all modern browsers. A few notes:

- **Autoplay** — Some browsers may require user interaction before playing audio. This is a browser security feature.
- **Mobile** — Embeds are fully responsive and work on mobile devices
- **HTTPS** — Your website should use HTTPS for best compatibility

### Promoting Your Music

Use sharing and embeds to promote your beats:

  <Card title="Social Media" icon="share">
    Share track links on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and other platforms to drive traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your Website" icon="globe">
    Embed players on your personal website or portfolio for seamless playback.
  </Card>

  </Card>
  <Card title="YouTube Descriptions" icon="youtube">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices

- **Use descriptive text** around embeds to provide context
- **Test embeds** on different devices to ensure they display correctly
- **Use album embeds** to showcase multiple tracks at once
- **Link to your producer page** in addition to individual tracks

## Sharing vs. Reposting

| Feature | Share | Repost |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Who sees it** | Anyone with the link | Your BeatPass followers |
| **Where it appears** | External (social media, websites) | Your profile's **Reposts** tab |
| **Requires account** | No | Yes |
| **Use case** | Sharing outside BeatPass | Sharing within the community |

Use **Share** to promote content externally. Use **[Repost](/help/social-features/reposts)** to share within the BeatPass community.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Embed isn't displaying">
    **Check these common issues:**
    - Ensure the iframe code is correctly pasted in your HTML
    - Verify your website allows iframes from external sources
    - Check for Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions on your site
    - Try the embed in a simple HTML file to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio isn't playing in embed">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Browser autoplay policies may require user interaction first (click play)
    - The track may have been removed
    - Check your browser's audio permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Embed looks broken on mobile">
    Embeds are responsive but some mobile layouts may need adjustment. Try:
    - Ensuring the container has adequate width
    - Removing any CSS that might constrain the iframe
    - Testing on different devices
