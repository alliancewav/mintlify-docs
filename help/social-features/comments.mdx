Comments let you share your thoughts on tracks and albums, engage with producers, and connect with other listeners. On tracks, comments are **time-stamped**—they appear at the exact moment in the waveform where you posted them.

## How Comments Work

### Time-Stamped Track Comments

When you comment on a track, your comment is linked to a specific position on the waveform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to a track page">
    Click on any track to open its dedicated page with the full waveform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on the waveform">
    Click anywhere on the waveform. Your avatar marker will appear at that position, and a text field will open.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your comment">
    Write your comment and press Enter to submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comment appears on waveform">
    Your avatar thumbnail appears at that position on the waveform. Other users can hover over it to see your comment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Play the track and pause at the exact moment you want to comment on—like a killer drop or a smooth transition—then click the waveform at that spot.
</Tip>

### Viewing Comments

Comments appear in two places:

1. **On the waveform** — Small avatar thumbnails show where comments were made. Hover over them to read the comment.
2. **Below the track** — A **Comments** section shows all comments with usernames and content.

## Comment Features

### Leaving a Comment

To leave a comment, you need to:

- Be logged in to your BeatPass account
- Click on the waveform or use the comment form below the track

Comments are text-based and visible to everyone who views the track.

### Replying to Comments

You can reply to existing comments to create threaded conversations:

1. Find the comment you want to reply to
2. Click the **Reply** button
3. Type your response and submit

Replies are nested under the original comment, making it easy to follow conversations.

### Deleting Comments

You can delete a comment if:

- **You wrote it** — Delete your own comments anytime
- **You own the content** — Producers can delete any comments on their own tracks or albums

<Warning>
  Deleted comments cannot be recovered. Think carefully before removing a comment.
</Warning>

## Where Comments Appear

On a track page, the **Comments** section appears below the track details. Each comment shows:

- The commenter's avatar and username
- The comment text
- A **Reply** button
- A **Delete** option (for your own comments or if you're the producer)

## Best Practices

### For Listeners

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="crosshairs">
    Reference specific parts of the track. "Love the hi-hats at 1:24" is more valuable than "Nice beat."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Constructive" icon="lightbulb">
    If offering feedback, make it helpful. Producers appreciate actionable suggestions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Show Appreciation" icon="heart">
    A simple "This beat is perfect for my project!" means a lot to producers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask Questions" icon="comment-question">
    Curious about a sound or technique? Producers often love to share their process.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### For Producers

- **Respond to comments** — Engage with your audience to build community
- **Thank your supporters** — Acknowledge users who license your beats
- **Moderate thoughtfully** — Only delete truly inappropriate comments
- **Use feedback** — Comments can help you understand what resonates

## Comment Notifications

Producers can receive notifications when someone comments on their content:

| Notification           | When You Receive It                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comments & Replies** | When someone comments on your beats or replies to your comments |

Configure your notification preferences by clicking the **bell icon** and then the **settings gear**, or go to `/notifications/settings`.
