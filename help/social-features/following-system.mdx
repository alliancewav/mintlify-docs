The following system helps you stay connected with producers and users whose music you enjoy. When you follow someone, their new uploads appear in your feed and you can receive notifications about their activity.

## How Following Works

### Following Users

You can follow any user on BeatPass:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit their profile">
    Navigate to the user's profile page by clicking their name or avatar anywhere on the site.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Follow">
    Click the **Follow** button in their profile header. The button changes to **Unfollow** once you're following them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay connected">
    You'll now see their activity and can opt to receive notifications about new content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Following Producers

Producers can be followed from multiple places:

| Location | How to Follow |
|----------|---------------|
| **Producer Page** | Click the **Follow** button in the producer header |
| **Track Page** | Click the producer name, then follow from their page |
| **Search Results** | Click through to the producer page and follow |
| **Similar Producers** | Follow directly from the "Similar Producers" section on producer pages |

<Info>
  Following a producer keeps you updated on their music releases. You can also follow their user profile for broader activity updates.

## Following vs. Liking

These are different actions with different purposes:

| Action | What It Does | Where It Shows |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Follow** | Subscribe to a user's or producer's activity | Your **Following** tab; their Followers count |
| **Like** | Save a specific track or album | Your profile's **Liked Beats** or **Liked Collections** tab |

You can like content without following the creator, and vice versa.

## Feed & Discovery

### Your Feed

When you follow users and producers, their activity populates your personalized feed:
