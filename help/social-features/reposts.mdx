Reposting is a way to share tracks and albums you love with your followers. When you repost content, it appears on your profile's **Reposts** tab and may show up in your followers' feeds—helping great music get discovered.

## How Reposts Work

When you repost a track or album:

1. **It appears on your profile** — Your reposts are visible on your profile's **Reposts** tab
2. **Your followers see it** — Reposts can appear in your followers' activity feeds
3. **The producer is notified** — The content creator may receive a notification (if enabled in their preferences)
4. **Repost count increases** — The track or album's repost count goes up

<Info>
  Reposts are like a recommendation to your followers. They're a way to say "Check this out!" without leaving a comment.

## Reposting Content

### From a Track Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the track">
    Navigate to the track page you want to repost.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Repost button">
    Look for the **Repost** button in the track's action bar (with the repeat icon), usually near the like and share buttons.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Repost">
    Click the button. It will change to **Reposted** with a highlighted icon, indicating the track is now reposted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### From Track Lists

You can also repost directly from track lists:

1. Click the **More** button (three dots) on any track
2. Select **Repost** from the menu

### From Album Pages

Albums can be reposted the same way as tracks:

1. Go to the album page
2. Click the **Repost** button in the action bar
3. The album is now reposted to your profile

## Managing Your Reposts

### Viewing Your Reposts

To see everything you've reposted:

1. Go to your **Profile** page
2. Click the **Reposts** tab
3. Browse all tracks and albums you've reposted

<Note>
  The **Reposts** tab only appears on your profile if this feature is enabled on your BeatPass platform.
</Note>

### Removing a Repost

To un-repost content:

1. Find the reposted track or album
2. Click the **Reposted** button (it will show the highlighted state)
3. The repost is removed from your profile

Removing a repost is instant. The producer is not notified when you un-repost their content.

- Content worth checking out

### Where They Appear

Repost counts are displayed:

- On track pages (in the stats area)
- In track lists (next to play counts)
- On album pages
- In your Producer Dashboard analytics (for producers)
