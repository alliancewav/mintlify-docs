## I Can't Log In

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong email or password">
    **Solution:** Double-check that you're using the correct email address. Passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure Caps Lock is off. If you're still having trouble, reset your password.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm getting an error message">
    Common errors and solutions:
    - **"Invalid credentials"** — Your email or password is incorrect. Try resetting your password.
    - **"Account not found"** — No account exists with that email. Check the spelling or create a new account.
    - **"Too many attempts"** — Wait a few minutes before trying again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The page isn't loading">
    Try these steps:
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Clear your browser cache
    3. Try a different browser
    4. Check your internet connection
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I signed up with Google, Facebook, or Twitter">

## Two-Factor Authentication Issues

If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't have my authenticator app">
    If you can't access your authenticator app, you can use a **recovery code** instead:
    1. On the 2FA verification page, click **Use recovery code instead**
    2. Enter one of your recovery codes (these were provided when you set up 2FA)
    
    Each recovery code can only be used once.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My code isn't working">
    - Make sure you're entering the code quickly — codes expire every 30 seconds
    - Check that your device's time is correct (incorrect time can cause code mismatches)
    - Try waiting for a new code to generate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I lost my recovery codes">
    Contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca** with your account email address. We'll need to verify your identity before disabling 2FA.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Social Login Issues

    2. Allow popups from beatpass.ca
    3. Try clicking the social login button again
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Account already exists' error">
    This happens when you already have a BeatPass account with the same email address. To connect the accounts:
    1. Click the social login button
    2. When prompted, enter your existing BeatPass password
    3. Your accounts will be linked
    
    After linking, you can use either method to sign in.
