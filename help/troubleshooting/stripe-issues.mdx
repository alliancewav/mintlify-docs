This guide is for **producers** who are having trouble setting up Stripe Connect or receiving payouts for their music on BeatPass.

</Note>

## I Haven't Connected My Stripe Account

To receive payouts, you need to connect a Stripe account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your Producer Dashboard">
    Navigate to your Producer Dashboard by clicking your profile and selecting **Producer Dashboard**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Finances">
    Click on **Finances** in your dashboard menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Connect Stripe Account'">
    Click the **Connect Stripe Account** button to start the onboarding process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Stripe onboarding">
    You'll be redirected to Stripe to set up your account. This takes about 5 minutes and requires:
    - Basic business/personal information
    - Bank account details for payouts
    - Identity verification documents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Payouts Can I Receive?

Once connected, you can receive earnings from:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Payouts** | Automatic revenue share from the subscription pool based on your contribution value |
| **Exclusive Sales** | 100% of your set price when someone purchases exclusive rights to your track |
| **Track Purchases** | 100% of track purchase revenue directly to your account |

<Tip>
  You keep 100% of your set price on all sales. The platform fee is added on top for buyers, not deducted from your earnings.
</Tip>

## Stripe Express vs. Regular Stripe — Common Confusion

<Warning>
  BeatPass uses **Stripe Express** accounts, which are different from regular Stripe accounts. This is the #1 source of confusion among producers.
</Warning>

| | **Stripe Express (BeatPass)** | **Regular Stripe (stripe.com)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Login URL** | [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) | [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com) |
| **Authentication** | Email + SMS/email code (no password) | Email + password |
| **Created by** | BeatPass during onboarding | You, at stripe.com |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I logged into dashboard.stripe.com but don't see my BeatPass earnings">
    You're in the wrong dashboard. Your BeatPass payouts go to a **Stripe Express** account, not a regular Stripe account. Go to [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) and log in with the email you used during BeatPass onboarding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I created a Stripe account at stripe.com — will it work with BeatPass?">
    **No.** A regular Stripe account created at stripe.com is not connected to BeatPass. You must use the **Connect Stripe Account** button inside your BeatPass Finances dashboard. This creates a Stripe Express account specifically linked to BeatPass.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have both a regular Stripe account and a BeatPass Express account on the same email">
    That's fine — they are completely separate accounts. Use `dashboard.stripe.com` for your regular Stripe account and `connect.stripe.com/express_login` for your BeatPass payouts. Bookmark both to avoid confusion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Stripe Onboarding Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onboarding link isn't working">
    If clicking the connect button doesn't redirect you to Stripe:
    1. Check that popups aren't blocked for beatpass.ca
    2. Try a different browser
    3. Clear your browser cache and try again
    4. If the issue persists, contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca**
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm stuck on Stripe's verification page">
    Stripe requires identity verification for payouts. Common issues:
    - **Photo rejected** — Ensure your ID photo is clear, well-lit, and shows all corners
    - **Address mismatch** — Your address must match your bank account records
    - **Document type not accepted** — Use a government-issued ID (passport, driver's license)
    
    If you're stuck, contact Stripe Support directly from your Express dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm from a country that isn't supported">
    If your country isn't in the dropdown during onboarding, you can still receive payouts using alternatives:
    
    - **Wise** — Open a multi-currency account at [wise.com](https://wise.com) to get US/EU/UK bank details
    - **Payoneer** — Get receiving account details at [payoneer.com](https://www.payoneer.com)
    - **Stripe Atlas** — Incorporate a US company at [stripe.com/atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) ($500 one-time)
    
    See [Unsupported Countries & Alternatives](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/unsupported-countries) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm in the UAE and onboarding is asking for a Trade License">
    The UAE requires a **business-type account** with Stripe — individual accounts are not supported. You need a Trade License (or freelancer permit) from a recognized UAE authority.
    
    **Affordable options for producers:**
    - **Sharjah Media City (Shams)** — Freelancer permits from ~AED 5,750/year (~$1,565 USD)
    - **Dubai Creative Clusters** — Permits for media and creative professionals
    - **RAKEZ / Ajman Free Zone** — Budget-friendly options
    
    You'll also need: Emirates ID (for nationals/residents), passport, residence visa (for foreign nationals), and bank account ownership proof.
    
    See [Regional Requirements — UAE](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/regional-requirements#united-arab-emirates-uae) for the complete guide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm in the UAE and need a Memorandum of Association">
    The Memorandum of Association (MOA) is required for LLCs and Free Zone LLCs in the UAE. If you're a sole proprietor or single-owner free zone establishment, the MOA is typically **not required** — your Trade License is sufficient.
    
    If Stripe requests an MOA, contact your free zone authority to obtain a certified copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stripe asks for documents I don't understand">
    Requirements vary by country. Common region-specific requests:
    
    - **Emirates ID** (UAE) — National ID card for UAE residents
    - **Trade License** (UAE) — Business license from a UAE authority
    - **My Number** (Japan) — Individual tax number
    - **NRIC / FIN** (Singapore) — National registration ID
    - **RFC** (Mexico) — Tax registration number
    
    See [Regional Requirements](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/regional-requirements) for what each country needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## My Account Shows "Pending" or "Verification Required"

If your Stripe account is connected but not fully active:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Charges not enabled">
    This means Stripe hasn't fully verified your account yet. 
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Go to your Producer Dashboard → Finances
    2. Click **Complete Setup** if shown
    3. Follow the prompts to provide any missing information
    4. Wait for Stripe to review (usually 1-2 business days)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payouts not enabled">
    Even if charges are enabled, payouts may need additional verification.
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Log into your Stripe dashboard directly at stripe.com
    2. Check for any pending requirements
    3. Provide any requested documents or information
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account restricted">
    Stripe may restrict accounts that:
    - Failed identity verification
    - Have unusual activity patterns
    - Haven't completed all requirements
    
    Contact Stripe Support or email us at **contact@beatpass.ca** for help.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## I'm Not Receiving Payouts

If your Stripe account is connected but you're not receiving money:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your earnings">
    Go to Producer Dashboard → Finances to see:
    - Your current contribution value
    - Estimated monthly earnings
    - Payout history
    
    If your contribution value is low, your earnings may be below the minimum payout threshold.

    Subscription revenue payouts are processed monthly, not immediately. Check your payout schedule in the Finances section.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Verify your bank details">
    Incorrect bank details can prevent payouts:
    1. Log into your Stripe dashboard at stripe.com
    2. Check your bank account settings
    3. Ensure account number and routing number are correct
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Payout failed">
    If a payout failed:
    - You'll receive an email from Stripe
    - Check your Stripe dashboard for details
    - Common causes: incorrect bank info, closed account, bank rejection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disconnecting Stripe

If you need to disconnect your Stripe account:

<Warning>
  Disconnecting will stop all payouts. Any pending earnings will need to be resolved before disconnecting.
</Warning>

1. Go to Producer Dashboard → Finances
2. Click **Disconnect** 
3. Confirm your decision

You can reconnect a different Stripe account later if needed.

## Track Purchase Payments

For track purchases (exclusive sales):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buyer paid but I haven't received money">
    Track purchase payments are processed through Stripe and typically arrive within:
    - **Standard payouts**: 2-7 business days depending on your country
    - **Instant payouts**: Available in some regions for a small fee
    
    Check your Stripe dashboard for the payout schedule.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Refund was issued">
    If a buyer requests a refund and it's approved:
    - The amount is deducted from your pending balance
    - If already paid out, future payouts may be adjusted
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Stripe Dashboard Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I access my Stripe Express dashboard?">
    BeatPass uses **Stripe Express** accounts. To access your dashboard:

    **Option A — Through BeatPass:**
    1. Go to **Backstage** → **Finances**
    2. Click the link to view your Stripe dashboard

    **Option B — Direct login:**
    1. Go to [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login)
    2. Enter the email you used during BeatPass onboarding
    3. Verify with the code sent to your phone or email

    **Do NOT go to dashboard.stripe.com** — that is for regular Stripe accounts, not Express accounts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I change my payout bank account?">
    Yes:
    1. Log into your Stripe Express dashboard at [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login)
    2. Go to Settings → Bank accounts
    3. Add your new bank account
    4. Remove the old one if needed

    You can also switch from a bank account to a debit card (or vice versa) if your country supports it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What information does Stripe share with BeatPass?">
    BeatPass can see:
    - Whether your account is connected and active
    - Whether charges and payouts are enabled
    
    BeatPass cannot see:
    - Your bank account details
    - Your personal ID documents
    - Your full balance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my country after onboarding?">
    **No.** The country you select during Stripe Connect onboarding is permanent and cannot be changed. If you need to switch countries, you would need to disconnect your current account and create a new one. Contact **contact@beatpass.ca** for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My Stripe documents expired and payouts stopped">
    Some countries (especially the UAE) require you to keep identity documents and business licenses up to date. Stripe monitors expiration dates and gives you **28 days** after expiry to upload renewed documents. If you don't update in time, payouts may be paused.

    To fix this:
    1. Log into your Express dashboard at [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login)
    2. Check for any notification banners about expired documents
    3. Upload the renewed document
    4. Wait 1-2 business days for Stripe to re-verify
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
