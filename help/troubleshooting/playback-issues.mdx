## Audio Won't Play at All

If you click play and nothing happens:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your volume">
    - Make sure your device volume isn't muted
    - Check that the BeatPass player volume slider isn't at zero
    - Ensure your headphones or speakers are connected properly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Allow audio in your browser">
    Some browsers block autoplay audio. If the play button isn't working:
    1. Click directly on the play button (don't just load the page)
    2. Check if your browser is blocking audio for this site
    3. Look for a muted speaker icon in your browser's address bar
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check browser compatibility">
    BeatPass works best with modern browsers:
    - **Chrome** (recommended)
    - **Firefox**
    - **Safari**
    - **Edge**
    
    If you're using an older browser, try updating it or switching to a different one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disable conflicting extensions">
    Browser extensions can interfere with audio playback:
    1. Try disabling ad blockers temporarily
    2. Disable any audio-related extensions
    3. Try incognito/private mode to test without extensions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Audio is Buffering or Stuttering

If audio keeps stopping or buffering:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your internet connection">
    Audio streaming requires a stable internet connection.
    
    **Try these solutions:**
    1. Test your connection speed at speedtest.net
    2. Move closer to your WiFi router
    3. Switch from WiFi to a wired connection if possible
    4. Close other apps or tabs using bandwidth
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wait for the track to buffer">
    The waveform display shows a progress bar indicating how much of the track has loaded. Wait for more of the track to load before seeking ahead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reduce device load">
    If your device is running slow:
    1. Close unused browser tabs
    2. Close other applications
    3. Restart your browser
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## No Sound from Specific Tracks

If some tracks play but others don't:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track may have been removed">
    If a track has been removed or made private by the producer, it won't play. The track page should show a message if this is the case.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio file may be processing">
    Newly uploaded tracks may take a few minutes to process before they can be played. Check back shortly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Refresh and try again">
    Sometimes a simple page refresh fixes temporary loading issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Player Controls Not Working

If the play button, seek bar, or volume controls aren't responding:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Refresh the page">
    Press **F5** or **Ctrl+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+R** (Mac) to refresh.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear your browser cache">
    Cached files can become corrupted. Clear your cache and try again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try a different browser">
    If the issue persists, try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for JavaScript errors">
    BeatPass requires JavaScript to be enabled. Make sure it's not disabled in your browser settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Audio Quality Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Audio sounds distorted">
    - Lower your device volume and the BeatPass player volume
    - Check if the issue occurs with all tracks or just one

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio sounds quiet">
    - Increase both your device volume and the player volume
    - Check your device's sound settings for any limiters
    - Some tracks may be mastered at lower volumes than others

## Mobile Playback Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Audio stops when phone locks">
    On mobile devices:

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audio plays through wrong speaker">
    Check your phone's audio routing:
    - Disconnect and reconnect Bluetooth devices
