## Upload Keeps Failing

If your upload starts but then fails:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your file format">
    BeatPass only accepts **WAV format** audio files to maintain quality:
    - **Audio**: WAV only
    - **Video**: MP4, MOV, WebM
    
    <Warning>Only WAV files are accepted for audio uploads. Compressed formats (MP3, AAC, OGG) and other lossless formats (FLAC, AIFF) are not supported. Convert to WAV before uploading.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File is too large">
    There's a maximum file size limit for uploads. If your file is too large:
    - Compress the audio (reduce bitrate)
    - Split longer tracks into parts
    - Contact support if you need to upload very large files
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Internet connection interrupted">
    Uploads require a stable internet connection. If your connection drops:
    - The upload will fail and you'll need to restart
    - Try uploading during off-peak hours
    - Use a wired connection if possible
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Browser timeout">
    Very large files may cause browser timeouts:
    1. Try a different browser (Chrome is recommended)
    2. Disable browser extensions that might interfere
    3. Don't navigate away from the page during upload
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Duplicate Detection Errors

BeatPass uses audio fingerprinting to detect duplicate uploads:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Duplicate audio detected' message">
    This means the audio you're uploading matches an existing track on BeatPass. This protection:
    - Prevents accidental re-uploads of the same track
    - Protects against unauthorized copies
    - Maintains catalog integrity
    
    **If this is your own track:**
    - Check if you've already uploaded it
    - If you need to replace an existing upload, delete the old one first
    - Contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca** if you believe this is an error
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="False positive detection">
    In rare cases, very similar tracks might trigger duplicate detection. If you believe this is a false positive:
    1. Make note of which track it matched
    2. Contact support at **contact@beatpass.ca**
    3. Provide both track names and explain the situation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Upload Processing Issues

After uploading, tracks go through processing:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track stuck on 'Processing'">
    Processing includes:
    - Waveform generation
    - Metadata extraction
    - Audio fingerprinting
    
    This usually takes 1-5 minutes. If it's been longer:
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Check if the track appears in your library
    3. If still stuck, try uploading again
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Metadata wasn't extracted correctly">
    BeatPass tries to read metadata from your audio file. If the title, artist, or other info is wrong:
    - Edit the track details after upload
    - For future uploads, ensure your audio files have proper ID3 tags
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Waveform isn't displaying">
    If the waveform isn't showing:
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Clear your browser cache
    3. The waveform should appear once processing completes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Album Uploads

When uploading a collection (album):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to upload an album">
    1. Select **Collection** mode on the upload page
    2. Drag and drop all tracks at once, or use the file picker
    3. BeatPass will group them into a single album
    4. Fill in the album details and save
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Some tracks failed in a batch upload">
    If some tracks failed during a batch upload:
    - Successfully uploaded tracks will still be saved
    - Failed tracks will show an error message
    - You can upload failed tracks individually later
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tracks are in the wrong order">
    You can reorder tracks after uploading:
    1. Go to the album edit page
    2. Drag tracks to rearrange them
    3. Save the changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Upload Form Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Required fields are missing">
    Before you can save a track, you must fill in:
    - Track name
    - At least one artist
    - Audio file (must finish uploading)
    
    The **Save Track** button will be disabled until all required fields are complete.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Form shows 'waiting for upload'">
    This means the audio file is still uploading or processing. Wait for:
    - Upload progress to complete
    - Processing/fingerprinting to finish
    - The status to show "Audio ready"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Changes weren't saved">
    If your changes didn't save:
    1. Check for any error messages
    2. Ensure all required fields are filled
    3. Try saving again
    4. If the issue persists, copy your content and refresh the page
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Drag and Drop Not Working

If drag and drop isn't functioning:

1. **Check browser support** — Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Disable conflicting extensions** — Some extensions block drag and drop
3. **Use the file picker** — Click the upload area to open a file dialog instead
4. **Check file type** — Ensure you're dragging audio/video files

---

## Upload Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a limit on how many tracks I can upload?">
    Upload limits may vary based on your account type. Check your Producer Dashboard for your current limits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maximum file size">
    Individual files have a maximum size limit. Very large files (over 50MB) may need to be compressed or split.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## After Upload

Once your track is uploaded:

1. **Fill in metadata** — Add title, artists, genre, BPM, key, and other details
2. **Set licensing options** — Choose your licensing type (non-exclusive, exclusive, or both)
3. **Add artwork** — Upload cover art for your track or album
4. **Save** — Click **Save Track** to publish

Your track will be live on BeatPass once saved.
