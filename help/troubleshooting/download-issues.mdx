## I Can't See the Download Button

If you don't see a **Download** button on tracks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You need a paid subscription">
    Track downloads are available to members with a paid subscription (Classic, Plus, or Pro plan). Free (Explorer) accounts can stream tracks but cannot download them.
    
    **Solution:** Upgrade to a paid plan to unlock downloads. Visit the pricing page or click **Upgrade** from your profile menu.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="You're not logged in">
    You need to be signed in to your account to download tracks.
    
    **Solution:** Sign in to your BeatPass account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Downloads are disabled for this track">
    Some tracks may have downloads disabled by the producer or platform.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## I'm Getting an Upgrade Prompt

When you click **Download** and see an upgrade prompt:

This means your current subscription plan doesn't include download access. The Free (Explorer) plan allows streaming only.

**Solution:** Upgrade to a paid plan:
- **Classic** — $29 CAD/month
- **Plus** — $45 CAD/month
- **Pro** — $59 CAD/month

All paid plans include unlimited track downloads.

## Exclusive Tracks Won't Download

Some tracks on BeatPass have exclusive licensing options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track is marked 'Exclusive Only'">
    If a track is set to exclusive-only licensing, it cannot be downloaded through the subscription. These tracks are only available for purchase by a single buyer.
    
    **Solution:** Contact the producer directly about purchasing exclusive rights to the track.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track has been sold exclusively">
    If a track was previously sold with exclusive rights, it's no longer available for download by other users.
    
    This protects the exclusive buyer's rights to the track.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Download Started But File is Missing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your Downloads folder">
    Look in your computer's default Downloads folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your browser's download manager">
    Click the download icon in your browser to see recent downloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check if the download completed">
