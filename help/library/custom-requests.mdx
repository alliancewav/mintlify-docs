description: "View and manage the beat requests you've submitted."
---

The My Requests section shows all the beat requests you've submitted to the BeatPass community. Here you can track your active requests, see their status, and delete requests you no longer need.

## What Are Beat Requests?

Beat requests let you describe the type of beat you're looking for. Producers can see your request and may create beats that match your specifications. It's a way to get custom-style beats from the producer community.

## Accessing My Requests

1. Click **My Requests** in the sidebar under Your Library
2. Or navigate to `/library/custom-requests` directly

## Understanding Your Request Cards

Each request card displays:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Your description** | The details you provided about what you're looking for |
| **Genre** | The genre you specified (if any) |
| **BPM range** | The tempo range you requested |
| **Key** | The musical key preference |
| **Mood** | The mood or vibe you described |
| **Budget** | Budget information (if provided) |
| **Reference track** | Link to a reference song (if provided) |
| **Time remaining** | Countdown until the request expires |

## Request Expiration

Beat requests have a limited lifespan to keep the request board fresh and relevant:

- **Countdown timer** — Shows hours, minutes, and seconds remaining
- **Warning state** — Requests turn yellow when expiring soon
- **Urgent state** — Requests turn red in the final 30 minutes
- **Expired** — After expiration, the request is no longer visible to producers

<Note>
  Once a request expires, it's automatically removed from the public beat requests page. You can always submit a new request if you're still looking.
</Note>

## Deleting a Request

To remove a request before it expires:

1. Find the request in your My Requests list
2. Click the **delete** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup

### Token Refund

If your request used a token and you delete it:

- **Token refunded** — You'll receive your token back
- **Confirmation** — A message confirms the refund

<Tip>
  If you no longer need a beat request, delete it early to get your token back and free up space for new requests.
</Tip>

## Searching Your Requests

Use the search bar to filter your requests by:

- Description content
- Genre
- Mood

## Request Status

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Normal timer** | Request is active with plenty of time |
| **Yellow/Warning** | Request expires within 2 hours |
| **Red/Urgent** | Request expires within 30 minutes |
| **Expired badge** | Request has expired and is no longer visible to producers |

## Tips for Effective Requests

When submitting requests (from the Beat Requests page):

- **Be specific** — Describe exactly what you need
- **Include references** — Link to songs with the vibe you want
- **Set realistic BPM** — Know the tempo range for your project
- **Mention the mood** — Help producers understand the feeling
- **Check regularly** — Browse new beats that might match your request

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did my request expire?">
    Requests have a time limit to keep the request board relevant. If your request expired, you can submit a new one with the same specifications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I edit a request after submitting?">
    Currently, you cannot edit requests. If you need to change details, delete the request and submit a new one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know if a producer responded to my request?">
    Producers don't respond directly to requests. Instead, they may upload beats that match your specifications. Browse new beats or enable notifications to see new uploads that might match what you're looking for.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my token if the request expires?">
    If a request expires naturally (not deleted), the token is not automatically refunded. Delete requests before they expire if you want to recover your token.
