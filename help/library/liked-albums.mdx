Your Liked Collections section stores all the beat packs (collections) you've saved. Collections are curated groups of beats organized by theme, mood, style, or producer.

## What Are Collections?

Collections (also called albums or beat packs) are groups of beats bundled together. They might be:

- **Producer collections** — A set of beats by one producer
- **Themed packs** — Beats grouped by genre, mood, or style
- **Curated selections** — Hand-picked beats for specific uses

## How to Like a Collection

- **On collection cards** — Click the heart icon when hovering over any collection
- **On the collection page** — Click the heart button on the collection's detail page
- **From context menus** — Right-click a collection and select the like option

## Accessing Your Liked Collections

1. Click **Liked Collections** in the sidebar under Your Library
2. Or navigate to `/library/albums` directly

## Managing Your Liked Collections

### Search

Use the search bar to filter your collections by:

- Collection name
- Producer name

### Sort Options

Organize your collections by:

| Sort Option | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Recently added** | Most recently liked collections first (default) |
| **A-Z** | Alphabetically by name |
| **Release date** | Newest releases first |

## Unlike a Collection

To remove a collection from your library:

1. Click the filled heart icon on any collection you've liked
2. The collection will be removed from your Liked Collections

<Note>
  Unliking a collection doesn't affect individual beats from that collection that you've liked separately.
</Note>

## Why Save Collections?

- **Quick access** — Return to collections you love without searching
- **Discover more** — Collections often have similar styles throughout
- **Stay organized** — Keep track of beat packs you want to explore further
