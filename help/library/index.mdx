## Library Sections

### Beats

Your **Liked Beats** section contains every beat you've saved by clicking the heart icon. These are sorted by when you added them, with the most recent first. You can:

- Search within your liked beats
- Sort by date added, name, or release date
- Play all your liked beats as a queue

### Playlists

Create custom playlists to organize beats however you like. Click the **+** button in the Playlists section to create a new playlist.

### Collections

When you like a beat pack (collection), it's saved here for easy access. Collections are groups of beats curated by theme, mood, or style.

### Following

See all the producers you follow. When producers you follow upload new beats, you'll be notified (if enabled) and can see their new content in your feed.

### History

Your listening history shows what you've played recently. Great for finding that beat you listened to but forgot to save.

### My Requests

Track the beat requests you've submitted. Each request shows:

- The specifications you provided (genre, BPM, mood, etc.)
- Time remaining before expiration
- Option to delete the request

### My Licenses

When you download a beat as a subscriber, a license certificate is automatically generated. The My Licenses section shows all your licenses with:

- Track name and producer
- License type (non-exclusive or exclusive)
- Issue date and status
- Download option for the PDF certificate
- Link to verify the license
