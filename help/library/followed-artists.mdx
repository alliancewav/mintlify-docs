The Following section shows all the producers you follow. Following a producer keeps you connected to their work — you'll see their new uploads and can receive notifications when they release beats.

## Why Follow Producers?

When you follow a producer:

- **Stay updated** — See when they upload new beats
- **Get notified** — Receive notifications for new releases (if enabled)
- **Easy access** — Quickly find their profile from your library
- **Build relationships** — Show support for producers whose style you love

## How to Follow a Producer

You can follow a producer from several places:

- **Producer profile** — Click the **Follow** button on their profile page
- **Beat pages** — Click the producer's name to visit their profile, then follow
- **Producer cards** — Click the follow button when browsing producers

## Accessing Your Followed Producers

### Sort Options

Organize your followed producers by:

## Unfollow a Producer

To stop following a producer:

2. Click on the producer to visit their profile
3. Click the **Following** button to unfollow
