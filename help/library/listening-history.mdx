Your Listening History keeps track of the beats you've played. It's perfect for finding that beat you heard but forgot to save, or for rediscovering tracks you've enjoyed.

## What Gets Tracked

Your history automatically records:

- **Beats you've played** — Any beat that starts playing
- **When you played it** — The date and time
- **Play order** — Most recent plays appear first

## Accessing Your History

1. Click **History** in the sidebar under Your Library
2. Or navigate to `/library/history` directly

## Using Your History

### Search

Use the search bar to find specific beats in your history by:

- Beat title
- Producer name

### Play All

Click the **Play** button to replay your history as a queue, starting with the most recently played.

### Play Individual Beats

Click any beat in your history to start playing it again.

## History vs. Liked Beats

| Feature | History | Liked Beats |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **What's saved** | Automatically tracks plays | Manually saved favorites |
| **How it's added** | Automatic when you play | Click the heart icon |
| **Sorted by** | When played | When liked or custom sort |
| **Permanent** | May be cleared over time | Stays until you unlike |

<Tip>
  If you find yourself replaying a beat from your history, consider liking it so you can find it easily later.
