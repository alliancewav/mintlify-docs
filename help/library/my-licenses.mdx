The My Licenses section stores all the license certificates for beats you've downloaded. Each time you download a beat with your subscription, a license is automatically generated and saved here.

## What Is a License Certificate?

A license certificate is your proof of permission to use a beat. It includes:

- **License ID** — Unique identifier for verification
- **Track information** — Beat title and producer
- **License type** — Non-exclusive or exclusive
- **Issue date** — When the license was granted
- **License terms** — What you can do with the beat
- **BeatPassID fingerprint** — For authenticity verification

## Accessing Your Licenses

1. Click **My Licenses** in the sidebar under Your Library
2. Or navigate to `/library/licenses` directly

## Understanding Your License List

Each license card shows:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Track name** | The beat you licensed |
| **Producer** | Who made the beat |
| **License type** | Non-exclusive (green) or exclusive (blue) |
| **Issue date** | When you downloaded/purchased |
| **Status** | Active, expired, or revoked |
| **License ID** | Unique identifier |

### License Type Colors

- **Green border** — Non-exclusive license (subscription download)
- **Blue border** — Exclusive license (purchased exclusive rights)

## Downloading License Certificates

To get a PDF of your license certificate:

1. Find the license in your list
2. Click **Download**
3. A new tab opens with your certificate
4. Print or save as PDF

<Tip>
  Keep copies of your license certificates for your records. They're useful for record labels, distributors, or anyone who needs proof you have the right to use a beat.
</Tip>

## Verifying a License

Every license can be verified publicly:

1. Click **Verify License** on any license card
2. A new page opens showing the verification status
3. Share this link with anyone who needs to verify your license

The verification page confirms:

- The license exists and is valid
- Who the license was issued to
- What beat it covers
- The license terms

## For Producers: Licenses Granted

If you're a producer, this page also shows licenses you've granted to others. These appear with a "Licensed to" label showing the licensee's name.

This helps you track:

- Who has licensed your beats
- Whether licenses are exclusive or non-exclusive
- When licenses were issued

<Note>
  For privacy, producers see the licensee's name but not their email address.
</Note>

## Searching Licenses

Use the search bar to find licenses by:

- Track name
- Producer name
- Licensee name (for producers)
- License ID

## License Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | License is valid and in effect |
| **Expired** | License has passed its expiration (rare for BeatPass licenses) |
| **Revoked** | License was cancelled (typically due to violations) |

<Info>
  BeatPass non-exclusive licenses are perpetual — they don't expire. Your license remains valid forever, even if you cancel your subscription.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I find my license?">
    Licenses are only generated when you download a beat. If you liked or played a beat but didn't download it, there's no license. Try downloading the beat again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a license for a beat I downloaded before?">
    Yes. Go to the beat's page and download it again. A new license certificate will be generated (you'll have multiple licenses for the same beat if you download multiple times).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my license shows 'revoked'?">
    Revoked licenses are rare and typically only happen if you violated the license terms. Contact support at contact@beatpass.ca if you believe this is an error.
