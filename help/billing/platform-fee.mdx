When you purchase a beat on BeatPass, a 12% platform fee plus a $3 flat fee is added to the producer's listed price. This page explains how the fee works and where your money goes.

---

## How the Fee Works

The platform fee is **added on top** of the producer's price—not deducted from it.

### Example

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| **Producer's listed price** | $100.00 |
| **Platform fee (12% + $3)** | $15.00 |
| **Total you pay** | $115.00 |

In this example:
- You pay $115.00
- The producer receives $100.00
- BeatPass receives $15.00 (12% of $100 = $12 + $3 flat fee)

<Tip>
  **Fee Formula**: (Beat Price × 0.12) + $3 = Platform Fee. For example: ($100 × 0.12) + $3 = $15.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Producers set their own prices and receive 100% of their listed price. The platform fee is a separate charge added at checkout.
</Note>

## What the Fee Supports

The platform fee supports:

- **Platform development** — Building and improving BeatPass features
- **Infrastructure** — Servers, storage, and technical operations
- **Secure payments** — Safe payment processing for all transactions
- **Support services** — Customer and producer support
- **Community features** — Beat requests, messaging, and discovery tools

---

## Fee Transparency

### What You See

When purchasing a beat:

1. **Product page** — Shows the producer's price
2. **Checkout** — Shows price + platform fee = total
3. **Invoice** — Itemized breakdown of charges

### No Hidden Fees

The 12% + $3 platform fee is the only additional charge. There are no hidden processing fees or surprise charges.

---

## Who Pays the Fee

| Party | What They Pay |
|-------|---------------|
| **Buyer (You)** | Producer's price + 12% platform fee + $3 flat fee |
| **Producer** | Nothing—receives full listed price |

This model ensures producers can set prices confidently, knowing they receive exactly what they list.

---

## Fee on Different Purchases

The platform fee applies to:

- **Beat purchases** — Individual track licenses
- **Exclusive purchases** — Exclusive rights to beats

### Subscriptions

The platform fee does **not** apply to subscription payments. Subscription pricing is fixed and inclusive.

## Comparison to Other Platforms

BeatPass's fee structure differs from some platforms where fees are deducted from the seller's earnings:

| Platform Type | How Fee Works | Producer Gets |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **BeatPass** | Fee added on top | 100% of listed price |
| **Other platforms** | Fee deducted | Less than listed price |

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is the fee added on top instead of deducted?">
    This approach ensures producers receive exactly what they set as their price. There's no guesswork about take-home earnings—a $100 price means $100 for the producer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is the fee negotiable?">
    The platform fee is fixed at 12% + $3 for all transactions. This consistent rate keeps pricing transparent and predictable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does the fee apply to all currencies?">
    Yes. The 12% + $3 fee applies regardless of the currency used (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD). The $3 flat fee is converted to the local currency equivalent at the current exchange rate at the time of purchase.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the minimum fee on lower-priced beats?">
    On lower-priced beats, the $3 flat fee represents a larger portion of the total fee. For example, on a $20 beat, the total fee is $5.40 ($2.40 + $3), meaning the flat fee makes up about 56% of the fee. This fee structure is designed to be competitive for typical beat prices ($50-$200 range) while ensuring the platform can cover processing costs.
