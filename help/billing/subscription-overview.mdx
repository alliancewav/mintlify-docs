## Understanding Your Subscription Status

### Active Subscription

When your subscription is active, you'll see:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Plan name** | The name of your current subscription tier |
| **Price** | How much you pay per billing period |
| **Billing cycle** | Monthly |
| **Renews on** | The date your subscription will automatically renew |
| **Payment method** | The card or payment method on file |

### Grace Period (Cancelled)

If you've cancelled but still have time remaining:

- Your plan shows as "Cancelled"
- An "Ends on" date shows when access expires
- You keep all features until that date
- You can resume your subscription during this period

<Note>
  The grace period lasts until the end of your current billing cycle. If you paid for a month and cancel mid-month, you keep access for the rest of that month.
</Note>

You can cancel a pending plan change before it takes effect. See [Managing Subscription](/help/billing/managing-subscription) for details.

## Payment Method on File

Your subscription overview also shows your saved payment method:

- **Card brand** — Visa, Mastercard, etc.

- **Expiration date** — When the card expires

<Warning>
  If your payment method expires or fails, your subscription may not renew. Keep your payment information up to date to avoid service interruption.
