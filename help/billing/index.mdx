## How Billing Works

### Subscription Plans

BeatPass offers different subscription tiers, each with its own set of features:

- **Monthly billing** — All paid plans are billed monthly, cancel anytime
- **Free tier** — Basic access with the Explorer plan

### Automatic Renewal

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period. You'll be charged using your saved payment method. If you cancel, you keep access until your current period ends.

### Grace Period

If you cancel your subscription, you enter a <Tooltip tip="The time between cancellation and the end of your current billing cycle, during which you keep full access.">grace period</Tooltip> where you still have access to your plan's features until the current billing cycle ends. During this time, you can resume your subscription without losing any benefits.

---

## Payment Processing

BeatPass uses secure payment processors to handle all transactions:

- **<Tooltip tip="A third-party payment processor that securely handles credit and debit card transactions for BeatPass.">Stripe</Tooltip>** — For credit and debit card payments
- **PayPal** — As an alternative payment option (when available)

Your payment information is never stored directly on BeatPass servers — it's securely handled by our payment partners (Stripe, PayPal).
