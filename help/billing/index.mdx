## How Billing Works

### Subscription Plans

BeatPass offers different subscription tiers, each with its own set of features:

- **Monthly billing** — All paid plans are billed monthly, cancel anytime
- **Free tier** — Basic access with the Explorer plan

### Automatic Renewal

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period. You'll be charged using your saved payment method. If you cancel, you keep access until your current period ends.

### Grace Period

If you cancel your subscription, you enter a "grace period" where you still have access to your plan's features until the current billing cycle ends. During this time, you can resume your subscription without losing any benefits.

## Payment Processing

BeatPass uses secure payment processors to handle all transactions:

- **Stripe** — For credit and debit card payments
- **PayPal** — As an alternative payment option (when available)

Your payment information is never stored directly on BeatPass servers — it's securely handled by our payment partners (Stripe, PayPal).

## Platform Fee

When purchasing beats or licenses on BeatPass, a 12% platform fee plus a $3 flat fee is added to the producer's listed price. This fee supports platform operations and development.

<Info>
  The platform fee (12% + $3) is added on top of the listed price, not deducted from the producer's earnings. Producers receive 100% of their set price.
</Info>

Learn more about how this works in [Platform Fee](/help/billing/platform-fee).
