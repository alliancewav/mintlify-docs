## Invoice Retention

Your invoice history is available in your account settings. Past invoices remain accessible as long as your account exists.

## Understanding Invoice Amounts

### For Subscriptions

The invoice amount matches your plan price for the billing period.

### For Beat Purchases

The total includes:
- **Track price** — Set by the producer
- **Platform fee** — 12% + $3 added to the price

For example, a $100 beat shows as $115 on your invoice.

## Failed Payments

If a payment failed:

- The invoice shows "Failed" or "Unpaid" status
- Your subscription may not renew until resolved
- Update your payment method and try again

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't find an invoice">
    Check that you're logged into the correct account. Invoices are only visible to the account that made the payment. If you recently made a purchase, it may take a few moments to appear.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The amount doesn't match what I expected">
    For subscriptions, the amount matches your plan price. For purchases, remember the 12% + $3 platform fee is added to the track price. Review the invoice details for a breakdown.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need an invoice for tax purposes">
    You can download any invoice from your billing history. The downloaded invoice includes all necessary details for accounting purposes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund for an invoice?">
    Refund policies vary. Contact support if you believe you're entitled to a refund. See the [refund policy](/help/billing/refund-policy) for more details.
