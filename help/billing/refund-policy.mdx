BeatPass is a digital music licensing platform. Because beats are instantly downloadable and license certificates are generated immediately, all sales are generally **final**. This policy exists to protect the digital assets and payout integrity of our Producers.

<Warning>
  **All sales are final** once a beat has been downloaded or a license certificate has been generated. Digital content cannot be "returned," and Producer payouts depend on completed transactions.
</Warning>

## Subscription Payments

Subscription payments are **non-refundable**:

| Scenario | Refund? | What Happens |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Cancel subscription** | No | Keep access until billing period ends |
| **Downgrade plan** | No | New price applies at next renewal |
| **Unused days remaining** | No | No prorated refunds for partial periods |
| **Delete account** | No | Subscription cancelled, no refund |

When you cancel, you enter a **grace period** where all features remain active until the end of your billing period. You can resume during this time without losing continuity.

<Info>
  Licenses for beats downloaded during an active subscription remain **valid and perpetual**, even after cancellation. See our [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) (Section 2.3).
</Info>

## Exclusive Beat Purchases

Exclusive beat purchases are **final** once payment is processed and the license certificate is generated. The beat is immediately marked as **SOLD** and removed from availability.

### 24-Hour Exception Window

A refund may be considered **only** if **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. The request is submitted **within 24 hours** of the purchase
2. The purchase was made **in error** (accidental purchase, duplicate charge, or technical malfunction)
3. The buyer has **not downloaded** the beat files (WAV, MP3, stems)

<Warning>
  **After 24 hours**, any purchase is considered a deliberate, non-accidental transaction. Refund requests submitted after the 24-hour window **will not be processed**.
</Warning>

### What Happens If a Refund Is Approved

If a refund is approved for an exclusive purchase:

- The **exclusive license is revoked**
- The beat is **re-listed as available** for other buyers
- The **platform fee** (12% + $3) is also refunded
- The Producer's payout for the transaction is **reversed or adjusted**

## Beat Request Tokens

Beat request tokens are **non-refundable**:

| Scenario | Monetary Refund? | Token Refund? |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Token used to submit request** | No | No |
| **Delete active request** | No | Yes (automatic, up to plan cap) |
| **Request expires naturally** | No | No |
| **Unused monthly tokens** | No | No (reset at month end) |

<Note>
  Deleting an active beat request may return the token to your balance automatically — this is a **platform token credit**, not a monetary refund. See [Understanding Tokens](/help/beat-requests/understanding-tokens) for details.
</Note>

## When Refunds May Be Considered

BeatPass may, at its sole discretion, process a refund in these **limited circumstances**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Charges">
    You were charged more than once for the same transaction due to a technical error. Provide transaction IDs or bank statements showing the duplicate charges.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Failed Delivery">
    Payment was processed but the digital content (beat files or license certificate) was not delivered due to a platform error, **and** the issue cannot be resolved by re-delivery.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unauthorized Transaction">
    The charge was made without your authorization (fraud). For unauthorized charges, you should **also** contact your bank or card issuer immediately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Accidental Purchase (within 24 hours only)">
    You made an unintentional purchase and have **not** downloaded any files or generated a license. The request **must** be submitted within 24 hours of the transaction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Chargebacks & Payment Disputes

<Warning>
  **Always contact BeatPass support first** before initiating a chargeback with your bank. We can often resolve issues faster than the bank dispute process.
</Warning>

### What You Should Know

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Contact support first** | Fastest resolution, account unaffected |
| **File chargeback without contacting us** | Account may be suspended pending investigation |
| **Fraudulent chargeback** (disputing after downloading) | Permanent account termination |

### How Chargebacks Affect Producers

BeatPass protects Producers from fraudulent disputes. If a chargeback is filed on a legitimate transaction where content was delivered:

- BeatPass submits evidence to the payment processor to **contest the dispute**
- The Producer's payout is **not affected** unless the dispute is resolved in the buyer's favor
- Fraudulent dispute patterns may result in the **buyer's account being terminated**

---

## Why This Policy Exists

BeatPass's refund policy is designed to:

- **Protect Producers** — Producers rely on completed transactions for their income. Reversing legitimate sales undermines their livelihood and digital asset value.
- **Respect digital goods** — Unlike physical products, digital beats cannot be "returned." Once downloaded, the content has been delivered.
- **Maintain platform integrity** — A strict but fair policy prevents abuse while providing recourse for genuine errors.
