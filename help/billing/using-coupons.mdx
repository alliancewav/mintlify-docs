BeatPass occasionally offers discount codes that reduce the cost of subscriptions or beat purchases. This guide explains how to find and apply them.

## Where to Find Discount Codes

Discount codes may be shared through:

- **BeatPass emails** — Promotional emails and newsletters
- **Social media** — Official BeatPass accounts on X, Instagram, and Discord
- **Producer promotions** — Some producers share codes with their audience
- **Special events** — Seasonal promotions or platform milestones

<Note>
  Not all plans or purchases are eligible for every discount code. The code will indicate what it applies to when you enter it.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My code isn't working">
    - Double-check the code is entered exactly as shown (codes are case-sensitive)
    - Verify the code hasn't expired
    - Confirm the code applies to the product you're purchasing (subscription vs. exclusive beat)
    - Some codes have a limited number of uses — it may have reached its limit
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use more than one code at a time?">
    Only one discount code can be applied per transaction. If you have multiple codes, choose the one with the best value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I apply a code after I've already paid?">
    Discount codes must be entered before completing payment. They cannot be applied retroactively. If you just subscribed, contact support — they may be able to help.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does the discount apply to renewals?">
    That depends on the code's duration. A one-time code only applies to your first payment. A repeating or forever code will continue to apply as described.
