Downgrading lets you switch to a less expensive plan while keeping your current features until your next billing date. The new plan takes effect when your current period ends.

## How Downgrades Work

### Scheduled, Not Immediate

Unlike upgrades, downgrades are **always scheduled** for your next renewal date:

| What Happens | When |
|--------------|------|
| You confirm the downgrade | Now |
| You keep current plan features | Until your next renewal |
| New plan activates | At your next renewal date |
| You're charged the new, lower price | Starting from renewal |

<Note>
  This ensures you get the full value of what you've already paid for. There are no partial refunds for downgrades.
</Note>

### Example

If you're on a $20/month plan and downgrade to $10/month:
- Today: You schedule the downgrade
- Until renewal: You keep all $20 plan features
- At renewal: Your plan switches to $10
- Going forward: You're charged $10/month

---

## Pending Downgrade

After scheduling a downgrade, you'll see a "pending change" in your subscription settings:

- **Current plan** — What you have now
- **Pending plan** — What you're switching to
- **Effective date** — When the change happens

### Cancelling a Pending Downgrade

Changed your mind? You can cancel a scheduled downgrade before it takes effect:

1. Click your **profile avatar** → **Billing**
2. Find the **Scheduled Plan Change** card showing your pending downgrade
3. Click **Cancel scheduled change**
4. Your subscription continues as normal

## What You Might Lose

Downgrading may affect certain features. Review what's included in each plan before confirming:

### Common Differences

| Feature | Higher Plans | Lower Plans |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Beat request tokens** | More tokens | Fewer tokens |
| **Storage space** | More space | Less space |
| **Premium features** | Full access | Limited access |

<Warning>
  If you're downgrading to a plan with less storage than you currently use, you may need to remove some content before the change takes effect.
</Warning>

## Timing Your Downgrade

Consider timing when scheduling a downgrade:

- **Right after renewal** — You get the most time with your current plan
- **Right before renewal** — Downgrade happens quickly
- **Mid-cycle** — Standard behavior, change at next renewal

There's no financial difference—you always keep current features until renewal.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I downgrade immediately?">
    Downgrades are always scheduled for your next renewal to ensure you receive the full value of your current billing period. You've already paid for your current plan until that date.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I want my money back instead of a downgrade">
    Downgrading doesn't provide refunds for unused time. If you have billing concerns, contact support for assistance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my content if I exceed the new plan's limits?">
    Your content remains accessible, but you may not be able to upload new content until you're within the plan's limits. Consider removing older content before the downgrade takes effect.
  </Accordion>
