## Where to Manage Your Subscription

All subscription changes are made in one place:

1. Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation bar
2. Select **Billing** from the menu
3. In the **Current plan** section, choose the action you want to take:
   - **Change plan** — To upgrade or downgrade
   - **Cancel plan** — To cancel your subscription
   - **Renew plan** — To resume a cancelled subscription (during grace period)

## How Plan Changes Work

### Upgrades

When you upgrade to a higher-priced plan:

- **Immediate access** — New features are available right away
- **Prorated billing** — You're only charged the difference for the remaining time in your current billing cycle
- **New billing amount** — Future renewals use the new plan's price

### Downgrades

When you downgrade to a lower-priced plan:

- **Scheduled change** — The downgrade takes effect at your next renewal date
- **Keep current features** — You maintain access to your current plan until renewal
- **Lower future billing** — Starting from the next cycle, you pay the new lower rate

<Note>
  Downgrades are never applied immediately. You keep your current plan's features until your next billing date, when the new plan takes effect.
</Note>

### Cancellations

When you cancel:

- **Grace period** — You keep access until your current billing period ends
- **No future charges** — You won't be charged at the next renewal
- **Can resume** — You can reactivate during the grace period without losing anything

---

## Pending Changes

If you've scheduled a plan change (like a downgrade), you can:

- **View the pending change** in your subscription settings
- **Cancel the pending change** if you change your mind
- **Wait for it to apply** automatically at your next renewal

---

## Things to Consider

### Before Upgrading

- Review what additional features you'll get
- Check the price difference
- All plans are billed monthly

### Before Downgrading

- Review which features you'll lose
- Make sure you don't need those features before your next renewal
- Note any changes to your beat request token count

### Before Cancelling

- You won't lose your account—just the subscription benefits
- Consider downgrading instead if you want to reduce costs
- Remember you can resume during the grace period
