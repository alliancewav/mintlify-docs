If you've cancelled your subscription but changed your mind, you can resume it during the grace period. Resuming restores your subscription as if you never cancelled.

---

## What Is the Grace Period?

The grace period is the time between when you cancel and when your current billing cycle ends:

| Situation | Grace Period |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Monthly plan** | From cancellation until your monthly renewal date |

For example, if you cancel on March 10th and your next renewal was scheduled for March 25th, you have until March 25th to resume.

During this time, you can resume your subscription at no additional cost.

## What Happens When You Resume

### Immediate Effects

- **Subscription reactivated** — Status changes back to active
- **Features continue** — No interruption in access
- **Renewal restored** — Your next billing date is set

### Billing

- **No immediate charge** — You've already paid for the current period
- **Next charge at renewal** — Normal billing resumes at your scheduled renewal date

### Example

You cancelled on March 10th with a renewal date of March 25th:
- March 10-20: Grace period (you decide to resume)
- March 20: You resume your subscription
- March 25: Normal renewal and charge occurs
- Subscription continues as if you never cancelled

## Requirements for Resuming

You can only resume if:

- **Within grace period** — Your subscription hasn't fully expired yet
- **Same account** — You're logged into the account that had the subscription

<Warning>
  Once the grace period ends, you cannot resume. You'll need to start a new subscription, which may be at current pricing.
</Warning>

---

## When You Can't Resume

Resuming is **not available** if:

- Your grace period has ended
- Your subscription was deleted (rather than just cancelled)
- There are issues with your payment method

In these cases, you'll need to subscribe again as a new subscription.

## Differences: Resume vs. New Subscription

| Aspect | Resuming | New Subscription |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Availability** | Grace period only | Anytime |
| **Immediate charge** | No | Yes |
| **Billing date** | Stays the same | Resets to today |
| **Pricing** | Original price | Current prices |
| **Process** | One click | Full checkout |

<Tip>
  If you're thinking of cancelling, remember that resuming is easy during the grace period. This gives you flexibility if your circumstances change.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see a resume option">
    The resume option only appears during the grace period. If your period has ended, the subscription has fully expired and you'll need to subscribe again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I resumed but my features aren't back">
    Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. Features should restore immediately after resuming.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will I be charged when I resume?">
    No. You've already paid for your current billing period. The next charge happens at your scheduled renewal date, which remains unchanged.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
