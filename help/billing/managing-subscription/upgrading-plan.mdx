Upgrading your subscription gives you access to additional features and benefits. When you upgrade, the change can take effect immediately, and you're only charged the prorated difference.

## What Happens When You Upgrade

### Immediate Access

When you upgrade:

- **New features activate instantly** — You can start using upgraded features right away
- **No waiting period** — The upgrade takes effect as soon as payment is processed

### How Billing Works

Upgrades use prorated billing:

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Upgrading** | You're charged only the prorated price difference for remaining days in your current billing cycle |

### Example

If you're 15 days into a \$10/month plan and upgrade to a \$20/month plan:
- You've used half your current period (\$5 value)
- You have \$5 credit remaining
- You pay \$20 (new plan) - \$5 (credit) = \$15 for this cycle
- Future months charge the full \$20

<Note>
  Exact proration calculations depend on your specific billing dates and plan prices.

## Requirements for Upgrading

### Payment Method Required

To upgrade immediately, you must have a valid payment method on file:

- A credit or debit card saved to your account
- Or an active PayPal connection (if available)

If you don't have a payment method, you'll be prompted to add one before completing the upgrade.

### Active Subscription

You can upgrade from:

- An active paid subscription
- A free plan
- A cancelled subscription still in its grace period

## Choosing the Right Plan

Before upgrading, consider:

- **Features you need** — What specific features does the higher plan offer?
- **Beat request limits** — Higher plans include more custom beat request tokens per month

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My upgrade failed">
    Check that your payment method is valid and has sufficient funds. The card may have been declined due to:
    - Insufficient balance
    - Expired card
    - Card issuer security block
    
    Try updating your payment method and attempting the upgrade again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't see the features after upgrading">
    Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. New features should appear immediately after a successful upgrade.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I was charged more than expected">
