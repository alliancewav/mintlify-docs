Cancelling your subscription stops future billing while letting you keep access to your plan's features until the end of your current billing period.

## What Happens When You Cancel

### Grace Period

After cancelling, you enter a "grace period":

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Subscription cancelled** | No future charges will occur |
| **Access continues** | You keep all features until the period ends |
| **Grace period ends** | On your original renewal date |
| **After grace period** | You lose access to paid features |

### Example

If you cancel on March 15th and your renewal was March 30th:
- March 15-30: Grace period (full access)
- March 30 onwards: Free tier only

<Note>
  You're not charged when you cancel—you've already paid for your current period. You simply won't be charged again at renewal.
</Note>

## What You Keep vs. What You Lose

### During Grace Period

You **keep**:
- All current plan features
- Access to your content
- Your account and profile
- Everything until the period ends

### After Grace Period

You **lose**:
- Premium features tied to your plan
- Additional storage space (may need to reduce content)
- Extra beat request tokens
- Other paid benefits

You **keep**:
- Your BeatPass account
- Basic/free tier access
- Your profile and followers
- Ability to resubscribe anytime

## Can I Get a Refund?

Cancellation doesn't provide a refund for the current billing period. You've already paid for this period, and you retain access through its end.

If you believe you should receive a refund due to special circumstances, contact support for assistance.

---

## Resuming After Cancellation

Changed your mind? During the grace period, you can **resume** your subscription:

- No payment required immediately
- Your subscription continues as before
- Next charge at your original renewal date

See [Resuming Subscription](/help/billing/managing-subscription/resuming-subscription) for details.

<Tip>
  If you're unsure about cancelling, remember you can resume during the grace period. You only permanently lose the subscription after the period ends.
</Tip>

## Alternatives to Cancelling

Before cancelling, consider:

### Downgrading Instead

If cost is the concern, you could [downgrade](/help/billing/managing-subscription/downgrading-plan) to a cheaper plan instead of cancelling entirely.

### Taking a Break

Your account remains active even without a subscription. You can:
- Keep your free-tier access
- Return and resubscribe later
- Your content and followers are preserved

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I cancelled but was still charged">
    Check the charge date versus your cancellation date. If you cancelled after the billing date, the charge may have already processed. Contact support if you believe there's an error.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't find the cancel option">
    Click your **profile avatar** → **Billing**. The **Cancel plan** button appears in the Current plan section. If you don't see it, make sure you're logged into the correct account and have an active subscription.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will I lose my uploaded content?">
    Your content isn't deleted when you cancel. However, if your new storage limit is lower than what you're using, you may need to remove some content.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
