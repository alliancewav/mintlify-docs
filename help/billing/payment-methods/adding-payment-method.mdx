## Security During Entry

When you enter payment details:

- **Encrypted connection** — Data is transmitted securely
- **Stripe handles processing** — Card details go directly to Stripe, not BeatPass servers
- **Minimal info stored** — Just card brand, last 4 digits, and expiration

<Note>
  Your full card number is never stored on BeatPass. It's securely handled by Stripe, the payment processor.
</Note>

## After Adding a Payment Method

Once added, you'll see:

- **Card brand** — e.g., Visa, Mastercard
- **Last 4 digits** — For identification
- **Expiration date** — When the card expires

This becomes your default payment method for subscriptions and purchases.

## If Your Card Is Declined

Common reasons a card might be declined when adding:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Invalid details** | Double-check the card number, expiration, and CVV |
| **Card not supported** | Try a different card |
| **Fraud protection** | Contact your bank to authorize the transaction |
| **Insufficient funds** | Ensure the card has available balance |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting an error when adding my card">
    Verify all details are correct. If the card is valid, your bank may be blocking the transaction. Try another card or contact your bank.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple cards?">
    Currently, one payment method is stored as your default. When you add a new one, it replaces the previous payment method.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my card information safe?">
    Yes. Card details are processed by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor. Your full card number is never stored on BeatPass servers.
