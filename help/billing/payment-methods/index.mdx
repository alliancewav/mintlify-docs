## When You Need a Payment Method

A payment method is required for:

- **Subscribing to a paid plan** — To process recurring payments
- **Upgrading your plan** — To charge the price difference
- **Purchasing beats** — For one-time transactions

### Without a Payment Method

If you don't have a payment method saved:

- You can use BeatPass with a free account
- You'll be prompted to add one when subscribing
- Existing subscriptions may fail to renew
