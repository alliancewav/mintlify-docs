## When to Update Your Payment Method

Update your payment method when:

- **Card is expiring** — Before the expiration date
- **Card was replaced** — New card number due to loss, theft, or upgrade
- **Card was declined** — After resolving issues with your bank
- **Switching cards** — You prefer to use a different card

<Warning>
  If your payment method fails at renewal time, your subscription may not renew. Update your payment information before your renewal date to avoid interruption.
</Warning>

## What Happens When You Update

### Immediate Effects

- **Old card removed** — Previous payment method is replaced
- **New card saved** — Your new card becomes the default
- **No charge** — Updating doesn't trigger a charge

### For Active Subscriptions

When you update your payment method:

- All active subscriptions automatically use the new card
- Future renewals will charge the new payment method
- No action needed on individual subscriptions

---

## If Your Card Was Declined

If a payment failed:

1. Check if the card has sufficient funds
2. Contact your bank to authorize BeatPass charges
3. Update to a new payment method
4. If your subscription lapsed, you may need to resubscribe

---

## Expiring Card Notifications

BeatPass may notify you when your card is about to expire:

- Check your email for expiration warnings
- Update your card before the expiration date
- This prevents failed renewal payments

---

## Updating PayPal

If you're using PayPal:

- Payment method changes are managed in your PayPal account
- Update your linked cards or bank accounts in PayPal
- Changes in PayPal automatically apply to your BeatPass payments

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My new card isn't being accepted">
    Double-check the card details. If everything is correct, your bank may be blocking the transaction. Try:
    - Contacting your bank to authorize online transactions
    - Using a different card
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will updating my card affect my subscription?">
    No. Your subscription continues as normal. The new card will simply be used for future charges.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I updated my card but was still charged on the old one">
    If the charge processed before you updated, it would have used the old card. Future charges will use your new payment method.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I remove my payment method without adding a new one?">
    If you have an active subscription, you need a valid payment method on file. You can cancel your subscription first if you want to remove the payment method.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
