## Overall Rankings

The **Overall** leaderboard combines all categories into a single composite score.

### Formula

```
Overall Score = (Points × 0.25) + (Plays × 0.20) + (Uploads × 0.15) 
              + (Quality × 0.15) + (Collaboration × 0.15) + (Earnings × 0.10)
```

Each component is first converted to a rank score (100 - rank), then weighted.
