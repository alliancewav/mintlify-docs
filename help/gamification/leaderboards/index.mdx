## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I appear on any leaderboard?">
    You need at least one published, public track to appear in rankings. Draft, private, or removed tracks don't count. Upload and publish a track to become eligible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often do rankings update?">
    Rankings update approximately every 5 minutes. When you switch categories, you'll see the latest cached data, with background refreshes every 3 minutes while viewing the page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Overall and individual category rankings?">
    Individual category rankings measure one specific metric (e.g., total plays). The Overall ranking combines all categories with weighted percentages to provide a holistic view of producer performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see my exact rank in each category?">
    Yes! The Overall leaderboard metadata shows your rank in each component category (e.g., "#3 Points • #7 Plays • #12 Uploads").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did my rank drop even though I uploaded a new track?">
    Rankings are relative to other producers. If others uploaded more content or their tracks performed better, your relative position may decrease even with your own growth.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are plays from bots or artificial sources counted?">
    No. BeatPass uses fraud detection to filter artificial plays. Only authentic listening sessions meeting minimum duration requirements count toward rankings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the Quality score calculated?">
    Quality measures metadata completeness: BPM (25%) + Key (25%) + Scale (25%) + Tags (25%). A track with all fields filled scores 100%. Your ranking is based on the average across all tracks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a track?">
    Deleting a track removes it from all calculations. Your Upload count decreases, total plays drop, and Quality average recalculates. Rankings update within 5-10 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I hide my profile from leaderboards?">
    Currently, all producers with published tracks automatically appear in leaderboards. This ensures fair, transparent competition. Contact support if you have privacy concerns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do private or unlisted tracks count toward rankings?">
    No. Only public, approved tracks contribute to leaderboard calculations. This ensures all ranked producers are discoverable by the community.
  </Accordion>
