## How Timeframes Work

### All-Time Rankings

- Includes all activity since your account was created
- Best for measuring overall career performance
- Shows your complete track record on the platform

### Rolling Windows (7d, 30d)

- Counts only activity within the specified window
- Updates as time progresses
- Great for measuring recent momentum and activity bursts

### Seasonal Periods (H1, H2)

- Fixed 6-month periods
- H1 = January – June
- H2 = July – December
- Used for seasonal competitions and comparisons

## Period-Specific Data

When you switch timeframes, the following data is filtered:

| Category | What's Filtered |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Uploads** | Only tracks uploaded within the period |
| **Plays** | Only plays occurring within the period |
| **Earnings** | Contribution calculated for the period |
| **Quality** | Based on tracks existing in the period |
| **Collaboration** | Collaborative tracks from the period |
| **Points (XP)** | All-time only (XP is cumulative) |

<Note>
  **Points/XP rankings** always show all-time totals since XP represents your cumulative platform experience.
