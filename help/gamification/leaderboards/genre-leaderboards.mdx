## Genre Rankings Overview

BeatPass does not currently have dedicated **genre-specific leaderboards**. Instead, genre performance is recognized through the **achievement system**.

<Info>
  The 7 leaderboard categories are: Overall, Points, Plays, Uploads, Quality, Collaboration, and Earnings. Genre-specific rankings may be added in future updates.

## Genre Achievements

Genre performance is rewarded through these achievements:

| Achievement | Criteria | XP | Rarity |
|-------------|----------|-----|--------|
| 🎯 **Genre Specialist** | Top 10% track performance within a genre | 1,500 | Rare |
| 🌈 **Genre Master** | Top 20% genre diversity with 3+ genres | 2,500 | Epic |
| 🎨 **Genre Virtuoso** | Top 10% genre diversity with 5+ genres | 4,000 | Legendary |

### How Genre Performance Is Calculated

- **Genre Specialist** — Measures how well your best track performs compared to other tracks in the same genre
- **Genre Master/Virtuoso** — Rewards producers who create music across multiple genres successfully

## Genre Diversity

Genre diversity is tracked by:

1. **Counting unique genres** across your track catalog
2. **Calculating diversity score** based on genre spread
3. **Comparing to other producers** for percentile ranking

<Note>
  To maximize genre achievements, upload tracks across different genres while maintaining quality.
