## How It All Connects

```
Activity → XP → Levels → Achievements → Leaderboard Rankings
   ↑                                            ↓
   └───────────── Recognition & Visibility ─────┘
```

1. **Activities** (uploads, plays, metadata, collaborations) earn XP
2. **XP** accumulates to increase your **Level**
3. Milestones unlock **Achievements** for bonus XP
4. Performance across all metrics determines **Leaderboard** position
5. High rankings increase **Visibility** and discovery
