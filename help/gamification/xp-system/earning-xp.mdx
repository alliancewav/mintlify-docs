## XP Sources

BeatPass awards XP for various producer activities. Here's exactly how much you earn:

| Action | XP Amount | Trigger |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Upload a track** | +100 XP | Each new track you publish |
| **Track play** | +1 XP | Per play on your tracks |
| **Complete metadata** | +50 XP | Per track with full metadata |
| **Collaboration** | +25 XP | Per collaborative track (2+ artists) |
| **Achievement unlock** | Variable | Based on achievement points (150-6,000 XP) |

---

## How Each Source Works

### Track Uploads (+100 XP)

When you upload and publish a track:

- XP is awarded immediately on successful upload
- Only public tracks earn XP
- Each track can only earn upload XP once (no duplicates)
- **All credited artists** on the track receive upload XP

<Info>
  If you upload a track with collaborators, each artist with a completed profile receives +100 XP.
</Info>

### Track Plays (+1 XP)

Every time one of your tracks is played:

- +1 XP per play event
- Plays must meet minimum listen duration
- Bot/artificial plays are filtered
- **All credited artists** on the track receive play XP

### Metadata Completion (+50 XP)

Complete metadata means having all these fields filled:

| Field | Required |
|-------|----------|
| **BPM** | Track tempo |
| **Key** | Musical key (C, D, E, etc.) |
| **Scale** | Major or Minor |
| **Tags** | At least one genre/mood tag |
| **Description** | Track description text |

When all fields are complete, +50 XP is awarded per track.

### Collaborations (+25 XP)

When a track has 2 or more credited artists:

- Each collaborator with a completed profile earns +25 XP
- XP is awarded when the collaborative track is published
- Multiple collaborations = multiple XP awards

### Achievement Unlocks (Variable)

Achievements award XP based on their rarity:

| Rarity | XP Range |
|--------|----------|
| Common | 100-1,000 XP |
| Rare | 1,500-2,000 XP |
| Epic | 2,500-3,500 XP |
| Legendary | 4,000-6,000 XP |

See the [Achievement Catalog](/help/gamification/achievements) for all achievements.

## XP Attribution for Collaborators

When multiple artists are credited on a track:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Track is published">
    Upload or admin publishes a track with multiple artists.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Artists are identified">
    System identifies all artists in the `artist_track` relationship.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Profile check">
    Only artists with completed user profiles are eligible for XP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="XP distributed">
    Each eligible artist receives the full XP amount (not split).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Collaborators without completed profiles** will not receive XP. If you're credited on tracks but not earning XP, complete your artist profile setup.
</Warning>

## XP Deduplication

The XP system prevents duplicate awards:

- Each track upload only earns XP once
- Re-uploading the same track doesn't award additional XP
- Database-level unique constraints prevent exploitation
- System logs track which source earned XP

---

## Admin Users

Admin accounts (user IDs 1 and 76) are excluded from XP attribution to prevent inflated stats.
