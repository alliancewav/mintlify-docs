## Overview

BeatPass features a gamification system that rewards producers with Experience Points (XP) for their activity on the platform. As you earn XP, you level up and unlock new producer titles.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Producers with an artist profile. View your XP and level in the **Producer Dashboard → Progress**.

## Earning XP

### XP Sources

You earn XP through various activities on BeatPass:

| Action | XP Earned | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Upload a track** | +100 XP | Each new track you upload |
| **Track plays** | +1 XP | Per play on any of your tracks |
| **Complete metadata** | +50 XP | When a track has full metadata |
| **Collaborate** | +25 XP | Per collaborative track |
| **Unlock achievements** | Variable | Based on achievement rarity |

### XP Attribution

XP is awarded to your user account, not your artist profile. This means:

- All your artist profiles contribute to the same XP total
- Collaborators also earn XP when your shared tracks get plays
- Only users with completed profiles are eligible for XP

<Note>
  **Collaborator XP**: When a track with multiple artists gets played, all credited collaborators with completed user profiles earn XP. Artists without completed profiles will not receive XP until they complete their profile setup.
</Note>

## Producer Levels

### Level Progression

Your producer level is determined by your total XP. The XP required for each level follows this formula:

```
XP Required = 100 × ((Level - 1) ^ 1.5)
```

## Tips for Earning XP

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Regularly">
    Each track upload is worth 100 XP. Maintain a consistent upload schedule to steadily grow your XP.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Your Metadata">
    Fill out all metadata fields (BPM, key, scale, genre, description, cover art) to earn 50 XP per track.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Promote Your Tracks">
    More plays = more XP. Share your tracks and engage with listeners to boost play counts.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Collaborate">
    Work with other producers to earn collaboration XP and potentially reach new audiences.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unlock Achievements">
    Achievements award significant XP bonuses, especially rare and epic achievements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## XP Deduplication

The XP system includes protection against duplicate awards:

- Each action (upload, play, etc.) is only awarded XP once
- Re-uploading the same track doesn't earn additional XP
- Plays are tracked individually to prevent exploitation

---

## Maximum Level

The maximum producer level is **100** (Legendary Producer). Once you reach level 100:

- Your progress percentage shows 100%
- XP to next level shows 0
- You continue earning XP but won't level up further
