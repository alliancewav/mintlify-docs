## Level System Overview

As you earn XP, you progress through producer levels from 1 to 100. Each level comes with a title that reflects your experience on the platform.

**Maximum Level:** 100 (Legendary Producer)

## XP Requirements

BeatPass uses an **exponential XP curve**, meaning each level requires progressively more XP:

```
XP Required = 100 × ((Level - 1) ^ 1.5)
```
