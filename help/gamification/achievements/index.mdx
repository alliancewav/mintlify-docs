## How Achievements Work

### Checking Criteria

Achievements are checked automatically when relevant actions occur:

- **Upload achievements** — Checked when you upload a track
- **Play achievements** — Checked when your tracks receive plays
- **Profile achievements** — Checked when you update your profile
- **Milestone achievements** — Checked periodically based on account age
- **Seasonal achievements** — Checked when uploading during holiday periods

### Percentile-Based Achievements

Many achievements use percentile rankings (e.g., "top 10%"). These are calculated relative to all producers on the platform:

- Rankings update as the platform grows
- Your percentile can change even without new activity
- Focus on consistent improvement rather than specific rankings

### Permanent Unlocks

Once earned, achievements are **permanent**:

- Achievements cannot be lost
- XP from achievements is added to your total
- Even if criteria change, earned achievements remain
