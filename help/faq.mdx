## Quick Answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is BeatPass free to use?">
    You can browse and listen to beats for free as an Explorer. To download beats with a commercial license, you need a paid subscription (Classic, Plus, or Pro). See [Plans & Pricing](/help/plans-and-pricing/index).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I keep my licenses if I cancel?">
    Yes. All licenses you obtained while subscribed are perpetual — they never expire, even after cancellation. You keep the right to use every beat you downloaded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do producers earn money?">
    Producers earn through two channels: a share of subscription revenue based on their tracks' contribution value, and 100% of the listed price on exclusive beat sales. See [Earnings](/help/earnings/index).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file format do I get when I download?">
    Non-exclusive downloads include WAV and MP3 (320 kbps). Exclusive purchases include WAV, tagged WAV, MP3, and stems (if available).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use beats on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube?">
    Yes. Both non-exclusive and exclusive licenses allow distribution on streaming platforms and monetized YouTube videos. Only exclusive licenses allow Content ID registration. See [Releasing Music with Licensed Beats](/help/downloads-and-licensing/releasing-music).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I become a producer on BeatPass?">
    Apply through the Producer Program. You can become a new artist, claim an existing profile, or apply for verification. See [Producer Program](/help/producer-program/index).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the platform fee?">
    A 12% + $3 fee is added on top of all BeatPass payments, including subscriptions and beat purchases. The fee supports platform operations and producer payouts. For beat purchases, the producer receives 100% of their listed price. See [Platform Fee](/help/billing/platform-fee).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I collaborate with other producers?">
    Yes. You can credit multiple producers on a track. Collaborators share the track's contribution value and each appear on the track's page. See [Collaborations](/help/uploading/collaborations).
