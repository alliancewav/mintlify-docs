description: "Understanding how BeatPass calculates each track's contribution value."
---

Each track on BeatPass receives a contribution value that determines how much of the subscription revenue pool you earn. This page explains the three factors that go into that calculation.

## The Three Factors

Your track's contribution value is determined by multiplying three factors together:

| Factor | What It Measures | Range |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Time Decay** | How long since the track was uploaded | 1.0 (new) → 0 (very old) |
| **Popularity Boost** | How many times the track has been played | 1x → 3x |
| **Collaboration Split** | How many producers are credited | Full value ÷ number of producers |

## Time Decay

Newer tracks naturally contribute more to the platform because they keep the catalog fresh and engaging. A track's time factor follows a 6-month "half-life":

- **Newly uploaded track**: 100% of base value
- **After 6 months**: 50% of base value
- **After 12 months**: 25% of base value
- **After 18 months**: 12.5% of base value

<Info>
  The decay is gradual, not sudden. Your track loses a tiny bit of value each day, not a large chunk at specific dates.
</Info>

This doesn't mean old tracks become worthless—it means the same track will earn progressively less over time unless its play count increases to compensate.

## Popularity Boost

Tracks that listeners actually engage with earn more than tracks that sit unplayed. The popularity boost ranges from 1x (no plays) to 3x (highly popular):

| Play Count | Approximate Boost |
|------------|-------------------|
| 0 plays | 1.0x |
| 10 plays | 1.67x |
| 100 plays | 1.91x |
| 1,000 plays | 2.25x |
| 10,000 plays | 2.50x |
| 100,000 plays | 2.67x |

The boost uses a logarithmic scale, meaning:
- Early plays have the biggest impact
- Going from 0 to 100 plays helps more than going from 10,000 to 10,100

## Collaboration Split

When multiple producers are credited on a track, the contribution value is divided equally among all of them:

| Producers Credited | Each Producer Gets |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1 producer | 100% of contribution |
| 2 producers | 50% each |
| 3 producers | 33.3% each |
| 4 producers | 25% each |

<Note>
  Collaborations are counted based on how many producer profiles are credited on the track, not how many people worked on it behind the scenes.
</Note>

## Putting It Together

**Example: A 3-month old track with 500 plays and 2 producers**

1. Time Decay: At 3 months, roughly 70% remains
2. Popularity Boost: 500 plays gives about 2.14x
3. Collaboration Split: 2 producers = divide by 2

**Final contribution per producer**: 0.70 × 2.14 × 0.5 = **0.75 points**

## What This Means For You

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload consistently">
    Because newer tracks have higher contribution values, uploading regularly helps maintain your earnings over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Promote your music">
    More plays directly increase your contribution value. Share your tracks and encourage listeners to check out your music.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality matters">
    One track with 1,000 plays earns more than ten tracks with 10 plays each. Focus on creating music people want to hear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collaborations share value">
    Working with other producers is great for reach, but remember the contribution is split. Make sure collaborations make sense for your goals.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Daily Updates

Contribution values are recalculated every 24 hours. This means:

- Yesterday's plays are reflected in today's calculation
- Time decay is applied continuously
- Your share percentage may change as other tracks' values change too

You can see your current contribution values and share percentage in your **Finances** dashboard under **Subscription Revenue Splits**.
