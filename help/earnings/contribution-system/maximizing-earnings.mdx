Earning more on BeatPass comes down to understanding how the contribution system works and making smart decisions about your catalog. Here are practical strategies to help you maximize your income.

## Upload Consistently

Because newer tracks have higher contribution values, uploading regularly keeps your earnings steady.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Weekly uploads">
    Aim to upload at least one new track per week. Consistent uploading maintains a steady flow of high-value tracks in your catalog.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality over quantity">
    One well-produced track that gets plays is worth more than multiple tracks that go unplayed. Focus on music you're proud of.
  </Card>

## Grow Your Plays

Play count is the most controllable factor in your contribution value. More plays = higher earnings.

### Promote Your Music

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share on social media">
    Link to your BeatPass profile and tracks on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engage with your audience">
    Respond to comments, thank followers, and build relationships with listeners who enjoy your sound.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborate with content creators">
    Reach out to YouTubers, streamers, and video creators who might want to use your beats.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build an email list">
    Notify fans directly when you drop new music to ensure immediate plays on release day.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Optimize Your Profile

- **Use a professional profile photo** — First impressions matter
- **Write a compelling bio** — Tell listeners who you are and what makes your sound unique
- **Organize your tracks** — Create albums and playlists that showcase your best work
- **Tag your music accurately** — Help listeners discover your beats through search

## Understand the Timing

The 6-month half-life means your earnings from any single track will decrease over time. Plan accordingly:

  <Accordion title="Front-load promotion efforts">
    Promote heavily in the first few weeks after upload when your track's time factor is highest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan seasonal releases">
    Consider timing uploads around periods when your audience is most active.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Re-engage with older tracks">
    While older tracks earn less, a surge of new plays can still boost their contribution value through the popularity factor.
  </Accordion>

## Strategic Collaborations

Collaborating with other producers can expand your reach, but remember that contribution value is split equally.

**When collaboration makes sense:**
- Working with a producer who has a larger audience
- Creating music in a genre you couldn't make alone
- Building relationships for future opportunities

**When to go solo:**
- When you can produce the track yourself just as well
- When the collaboration wouldn't expand your reach
- When maximizing earnings per track is your priority

## Diversify Your Revenue

Don't rely solely on subscription revenue. BeatPass offers multiple ways to earn:

| Revenue Stream | Best For |
|----------------|----------|
| **Subscription sharing** | Building passive income from your catalog |
| **Exclusive sales** | High-value transactions on your best work |

<Info>
  Consider making some tracks exclusive-only if you believe they have high commercial value. These won't contribute to subscription revenue but can generate significant income through direct sales.
</Info>

## Set Up Payments Correctly

You can only earn if your payment account is properly connected.

<Warning>
  If your Stripe account isn't fully set up, your share of subscription revenue is redistributed to other producers. Make sure your account is complete and verified.
</Warning>

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Stripe Connect account created
- [ ] Bank account or debit card added
- [ ] Identity verification completed
- [ ] Payouts enabled (green status in Finances)

## Track Your Progress

Use your **Finances** dashboard to monitor:

- **Contribution values** — See which tracks are earning the most
- **Share percentage** — Track how your share compares over time
- **Payout history** — Review your actual earnings by period
- **Transaction details** — Understand exactly where your money comes from

Regular monitoring helps you understand what's working and adjust your strategy accordingly.
