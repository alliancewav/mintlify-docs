title: "Contribution System"
description: "How BeatPass calculates your share of subscription revenue using contribution values."
---

The contribution system determines how subscription revenue is distributed fairly among all producers on BeatPass. Every track earns a "contribution value" based on its popularity and activity, and your share of the monthly revenue pool is proportional to your tracks' combined contribution.

## What is Contribution Value?

Contribution value is a number assigned to each track that represents its relative value to the platform. This value is calculated using three factors:

  <Card title="Time Since Upload" icon="clock">
    Newer tracks have higher contribution values. Value gradually decreases over time with a 6-month half-life.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number of Plays" icon="play">
    More popular tracks earn higher contribution values. Tracks with more plays get a boost up to 3x their base value.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaborations" icon="users">
    When multiple producers are credited on a track, the contribution value is split equally among all collaborators.

## How Revenue Distribution Works

Each month, when a subscriber pays their membership fee:

1. **Revenue pool is calculated** — The subscription base amount goes into the monthly producer pool
2. **Total contributions are summed** — The platform adds up all track contribution values
3. **Your share is determined** — Your percentage equals your tracks' contributions divided by the total
4. **Payments are made** — Your share of the revenue is transferred to your Stripe account

<Info>
  You receive 100% of your calculated share. The platform fee (12% + $3) is added on top of all payments and is not deducted from producer payouts.
</Info>

## Example

Imagine the monthly subscription revenue pool is $10,000 and the total platform contribution value is 5,000.

- **Your tracks' combined contribution**: 50 points
- **Your share**: 50 ÷ 5,000 = 1%
- **Your payout**: $10,000 × 1% = $100

## Why This System?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fair to all producers">
    Every producer earns based on the actual value their music brings to the platform, not just who uploads the most tracks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rewards engagement">
    Tracks that listeners actually play earn more than tracks that sit dormant. This encourages uploading quality over quantity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Encourages fresh content">
    The time decay factor ensures newer music gets a boost, keeping the platform fresh and rewarding consistent uploaders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transparent calculation">
    You can see your contribution values and share percentage in your Finances dashboard at any time.

## Contribution Updates

Track contribution values are recalculated daily to ensure they reflect the latest play counts and time factors. You can view your current contribution data in your **Finances** dashboard.

## Exclusions

Some tracks are not eligible for subscription revenue sharing:

- **Exclusive-only tracks** — Tracks set to exclusive licensing only do not contribute to the subscription pool since they can only be purchased directly
- **Tracks without a connected payment account** — If your Stripe account isn't fully set up, your share is redistributed to other eligible producers
