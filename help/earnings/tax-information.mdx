## For Producers

### Your Tax Responsibility

As stated in our [Terms of Service](https://open.beatpass.ca/pages/terms-of-service) (Section 8.2): **Producers are responsible for their own taxes.** This includes income tax, self-employment tax, VAT/GST, and any other taxes applicable in your jurisdiction.

BeatPass earnings — whether from subscription revenue sharing or exclusive beat sales — are generally considered **taxable income** in most countries.

### Tax Forms (United States)

If you're a US-based Producer receiving payouts through Stripe Connect:

| Form | When Issued | Threshold |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **1099-K** | January (for prior year) | Per current IRS thresholds |
| **W-9** | During Stripe onboarding | Required before first payout |

<Info>
  IRS reporting thresholds may change. Stripe issues 1099-K forms based on current IRS requirements. Even if you don't receive a 1099-K, you are still responsible for reporting all income.
</Info>

### Accessing Tax Documents

Tax forms are available through your **Stripe Express Dashboard**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Stripe Express">
    Go to [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) and sign in with the email used for your BeatPass Stripe setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tax Forms">
    Look for the **Tax Forms** or **Tax Documents** section in your Express dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Forms">
    Download your 1099-K or other tax documents as needed for your tax filing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Tax forms are managed by Stripe, not BeatPass. If you have questions about your tax documents, visit [Stripe's support](https://support.stripe.com) or consult your tax advisor.
</Note>

### Canadian Producers

Canadian Producers should be aware of:

- **Self-employment income** — BeatPass earnings are typically considered self-employment income for Canadian tax purposes
- **GST/HST** — If your worldwide taxable revenue exceeds \$30,000 in any four consecutive calendar quarters, you may need to register for and collect GST/HST
- **No T4 issued** — BeatPass does not issue T4 slips; Producers are independent contractors, not employees
- **Business expenses** — Equipment, software, and other production costs may be deductible as business expenses

### International Producers

If you're based outside the US and Canada:

- **Report earnings locally** — BeatPass earnings should be reported as income in your country of residence
- **VAT considerations** — Some countries (e.g., UAE with 5% VAT, EU member states) may require VAT registration depending on your revenue. Stripe may apply VAT on its processing fees
- **Currency conversion** — If you receive payouts in a different currency than your local currency, exchange rate differences may have tax implications
- **Using Wise/Payoneer** — If you receive payouts through a multi-currency account (see [Unsupported Countries](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/unsupported-countries)), the tax jurisdiction typically follows your country of **tax residence**, not the country of the bank account
- **Stripe Atlas users** — If you incorporated a US entity through Stripe Atlas, you may have US tax filing obligations in addition to obligations in your home country

### Record-Keeping Recommendations

Good records make tax time easier:

| What to Track | Where to Find It |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Total earnings** | Producer Dashboard → Finances |
| **Payout history** | Stripe Express Dashboard |
| **Transaction details** | Producer Dashboard → Finances → Transaction list |
| **Platform fees paid** | Visible on each transaction |
| **Business expenses** | Your own records (equipment, software, etc.) |

<Tip>
  Export your earnings data regularly. Your **Finances dashboard** shows transaction history, and the **Stripe Express dashboard** provides payout records and tax documents.
</Tip>

## For Consumers

### Subscription & Purchase Taxes

- **Sales tax / VAT** may be applied to your subscription or beat purchases depending on your location
- Tax amounts, if applicable, are shown at **checkout before payment**
- BeatPass collects and remits sales tax where required by law
- Your **invoices** (profile avatar → Billing → Payment history) show any tax amounts charged

### Beat Purchase Deductions

If you use beats for commercial projects, the cost of licenses and subscriptions may be a **deductible business expense**. Consult your tax advisor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does BeatPass withhold taxes from my earnings?">
    BeatPass does not withhold income taxes from Producer payouts. Producers receive 100% of their earnings (less any Stripe processing fees) and are responsible for paying their own taxes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will I receive a tax form from BeatPass?">
    Tax forms (like 1099-K) are issued by **Stripe**, not BeatPass directly. US Producers who meet IRS reporting thresholds will receive a 1099-K through their Stripe Express dashboard. International Producers should check their local tax authority's requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm in the UAE — do I need to worry about VAT?">
    The UAE has a 5% VAT. Depending on your revenue level and business structure, you may need to register for VAT. Stripe may also charge VAT on its processing fees if you don't provide a valid Tax Registration Number (TRN) during onboarding. See [Regional Requirements](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/regional-requirements) for UAE-specific details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are BeatPass earnings considered self-employment income?">
    In most jurisdictions, yes. Producers are independent contractors, not BeatPass employees. Your earnings are typically classified as self-employment or freelance income, which may have different tax rates and obligations than employment income.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I deduct my production costs?">
    In many jurisdictions, business expenses directly related to your beat production (software, equipment, samples, etc.) may be deductible. Keep receipts and consult your tax advisor for specifics.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I earn in a different currency?">
    If your payouts are in a different currency than your local tax currency, you'll need to convert amounts at the exchange rate on the date of each transaction (or use an average rate if permitted by your tax authority). Keep records of exchange rates used.
  </Accordion>
