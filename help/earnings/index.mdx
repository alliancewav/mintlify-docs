BeatPass offers producers multiple ways to earn money from their music. You keep 100% of your track or subscription earnings—the platform fee (**12% + \$3 CAD flat**) is added on top of customer pricing instead of being taken out of your share.

## Revenue Streams

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Subscription Revenue Sharing" icon="repeat">
    Every month, subscription revenue is distributed among producers based on how much value their tracks contribute to the platform. The more your beats are played, the larger your share.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exclusive Beat Sales" icon="shopping-bag">
    Sell beats exclusively with custom pricing. When someone purchases an exclusive license, you receive the full sale amount directly to your connected Stripe account.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your payment account** — Set up Stripe Connect (all three indicators — **Connected**, **Charges Enabled**, and **Payouts Enabled** — must be green before money can move)
2. **Upload your beats** — Your tracks begin earning contribution value immediately
3. **Get paid automatically** — Earnings are deposited directly to your bank account on Stripe’s payout schedule (2–7 business days depending on country)
