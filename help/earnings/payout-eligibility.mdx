To receive earnings from BeatPass, you must meet certain eligibility requirements. This ensures payments can be processed securely and in compliance with financial regulations.

## Basic Requirements

  <Card title="Producer Profile" icon="user">
    You must have a producer profile on BeatPass. If you don't have one, create your profile through the **Backstage** area.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stripe Connect Account" icon="wallet">
    Your Stripe Connect account must be fully set up and verified before you can receive any payouts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Stripe Account Status

Your Stripe account must show the following status indicators before payouts can be processed:

| Status | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Connected** | Your Stripe account is linked to BeatPass |
| **Charges Enabled** | Your account can accept payments |
| **Payouts Enabled** | Your account can receive money transfers |
| **Details Submitted** | You've completed all required verification |

<Info>
  You can check your account status in your **Finances** dashboard. If payouts aren't enabled yet, you'll see prompts to complete the required steps.
</Info>

## Minimum Payout Amount

Stripe requires a minimum balance of **\$10 USD** (or equivalent) before processing a payout to your bank account. Balances below this threshold will accumulate until the minimum is reached.

## Verification Requirements

Stripe may require verification of your identity to comply with financial regulations. Common requirements include:

- **Government-issued ID** — Driver's license, passport, or national ID card
- **Date of birth** — Must match your ID
- **Address** — Proof of residence may be required
- **Tax information** — Depending on your country, you may need to provide tax identification

<Note>
  Verification requirements vary by country. Stripe will guide you through exactly what's needed based on where you're located.
</Note>

## What Happens if You're Not Eligible

If your Stripe account isn't fully set up when a payout is calculated:

1. **Your share is marked as "excluded"** — You'll see this in your Subscription Revenue Splits history
2. **Funds are redistributed** — Your portion is distributed among other eligible producers
3. **You don't lose future earnings** — Once your account is set up, you'll receive future payouts normally

<Warning>
  Past excluded payouts cannot be recovered. Make sure your Stripe account is fully configured before your first payout period.
</Warning>
