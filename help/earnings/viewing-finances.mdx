## Dashboard Overview

When you open the Finances dashboard, you'll see several key sections:

### Account Status Header

At the top, you'll see your Stripe connection status:

- **Connected** — Your account is linked to BeatPass
- **Charges Enabled** — You can receive payments
- **Payouts Enabled** — Money can be transferred to your bank
- **Setup Required** — If any status shows a warning, click to complete setup

### Balance Overview

The balance section shows four key metrics:

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Total Balance** | Current amount in your Stripe account |
| **Future Payouts** | Money scheduled to transfer but not yet sent |
| **In Transit** | Funds currently being transferred to your bank |
| **Lifetime Volume** | Total amount you've earned since joining |

<Info>
  Balances are displayed in your primary currency. If you've received payments in multiple currencies, you'll see a breakdown by currency.
</Info>

### Transaction List

Below your balance, you'll find a list of all your transactions including:

- **Subscription revenue splits** — Monthly payouts from the contribution pool
- **Exclusive sales** — Direct beat purchases
- **Payouts** — Transfers to your bank account

Each transaction shows:
- Date
- Amount
- Status (Paid, Pending, Failed)
- Details (click to view full breakdown)

## Understanding Subscription Revenue Splits

For each subscription payout, you can view detailed information:

### Split Details

- **Billing Period** — The month this payout covers
- **Amount** — Your total payout
- **Original Amount** — Your calculated share before any adjustments
- **Redistribution Bonus** — Extra amount if ineligible producers' shares were redistributed
- **Share Percentage** — Your percentage of the total pool
- **Contribution Value** — Your tracks' combined contribution

### Payout Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Paid** | Successfully transferred to your balance |
| **Pending** | Being processed |
| **Failed** | Error occurred (system will retry up to 5 times) |
| **Excluded** | You weren't eligible (no active Stripe account) |

<Note>
  If a payout fails, the system automatically retries up to 5 times. Check your Stripe account configuration if failures persist.
</Note>

## Filtering Transactions

Use the filter tabs to view specific transaction types:

- **All** — Every transaction
- **Paid** — Successfully completed transactions
- **Pending** — Transactions being processed
- **Failed** — Transactions that encountered errors
- **Excluded** — Payouts you weren't eligible for

## Multiple Producer Profiles

If you manage multiple producer profiles, you can switch between them using the artist selector dropdown at the top of the Finances page.

## Cache and Updates

Financial data is cached for performance. You'll see:

- **Last Updated** — When data was last refreshed from Stripe
- **Cached indicator** — If you're viewing slightly older data

The cache refreshes regularly, so your data stays current.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see any transactions?">
    Transactions appear after your first subscription revenue split or direct sale. Make sure your Stripe account is fully set up to receive payments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does 'redistribution bonus' mean?">
    When a producer isn't eligible for a payout (no Stripe account), their share is redistributed among eligible producers. A bonus means you received a portion of that redistribution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my balance different from my bank deposit?">
    Your Stripe balance shows your total available funds. Bank deposits occur automatically on Stripe's payout schedule (typically every 2-7 business days).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I view transactions by date range?">
    Currently, transactions are shown in reverse chronological order. Use pagination to view older transactions.
