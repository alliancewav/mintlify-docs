## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your Finances dashboard">
    Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation, then select **Backstage**. From your Producer Dashboard, click **Finances** in the navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the connection process">
    If you haven't connected Stripe yet, you'll see an onboarding screen with the **Connect Stripe Account Now** button. Click it to begin.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create or sign in to Stripe">
    You'll be redirected to Stripe's secure website. Either:
    - **Create a new Stripe account** — If you don't have one
    - **Sign in** — If you already have a Stripe account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your personal information">
    Provide your:
    - Full legal name (as on your ID)
    - Date of birth
    - Home address
    - Phone number
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add your banking information">
    Choose how you want to receive payouts:
    - **Bank account** — Enter your account and routing number
    - **Debit card** — Add a Visa or Mastercard debit card
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify your identity">
    Upload a clear photo of your government-issued ID. Make sure:
    - All text is readable
    - All four corners are visible
    - There's no glare or blur
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and submit">
    Review your information for accuracy, then submit. Stripe typically verifies accounts within 1-2 business days.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to BeatPass">
    After completing the Stripe setup, you'll be redirected back to BeatPass. Your **Finances** dashboard will show your account status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Setup

Once your account is verified, you'll see:

| Status | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| **Connected** | Your account is linked to BeatPass |
| **Charges Enabled** | You can receive payments |
| **Payouts Enabled** | Money can be transferred to your bank |

<Info>
  All three indicators should show green checkmarks. If any show warnings, click to see what additional information is needed.
</Info>

## Completing Pending Requirements

Sometimes Stripe needs additional verification. If you see pending requirements:

1. Go to your **Finances** dashboard
2. Click the **Complete setup** or warning indicator
3. Follow the prompts to provide additional information
4. Wait for Stripe to verify (usually 1-2 business days)

### Common Additional Requirements

- **Additional ID verification** — Stripe may request a second form of ID
- **Address verification** — A utility bill or bank statement showing your address
- **Tax information** — Tax forms or identification numbers

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I was redirected back but my status shows 'Setup Required'">
    You may not have completed all steps on Stripe. Click **Complete Setup** to continue where you left off.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My ID was rejected">
    Common reasons for rejection:
    - Photo is blurry or has glare
    - ID is expired
    - Not all corners are visible
    - Photo is of a photocopy, not the original
    
    Retake the photo in good lighting and try again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't see the setup button">
    Make sure you:
    - Are logged in to BeatPass
    - Have a producer profile created
    - Are viewing the Finances page (not another dashboard section)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The process is taking longer than expected">
    In rare cases, Stripe may take up to 5-7 business days for verification, especially for:
    - Accounts in certain countries
    - Cases requiring manual review
    - First-time Stripe users
    
    You'll receive an email from Stripe when your account is ready.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I already have a Stripe account—can I use it?">
    Yes! When redirected to Stripe, sign in with your existing account instead of creating a new one. BeatPass will connect to your existing Stripe account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
