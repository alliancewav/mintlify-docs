This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up Stripe Connect. The entire process takes about 5 minutes if you have your information ready.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have the following ready:

- Government-issued photo ID
- Bank account or debit card information
- Tax identification number (if required in your country)

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your Finances dashboard">
    Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation, then select **Backstage**. From your Producer Dashboard, click **Finances** in the navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the connection process">
    If you haven't connected Stripe yet, you'll see an onboarding screen with the **Connect Stripe Account Now** button. Click it to begin.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm your country">
    A dialog will ask you to select the country where you reside and have a bank account. This is critical — **your country cannot be changed after setup**.
    
    - If your country is in the supported list, select it and continue
    - If your country is **not listed**, see the dialog's alternative options (Wise, Payoneer, Stripe Atlas) or visit [Unsupported Countries & Alternatives](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/unsupported-countries)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your Stripe Express account">
    You'll be redirected to Stripe's secure website to create a **Stripe Express** account. This is different from a regular Stripe account — it's a streamlined account specifically for receiving payouts from BeatPass.
    
    <Info>
      If you already have a regular Stripe account at stripe.com, your BeatPass Express account is **separate**. You don't need to sign into your existing Stripe account.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your personal information">
    Provide your:
    - Full legal name (as on your ID)
    - Date of birth
    - Home address
    - Phone number

    **For UAE producers:** You'll also need your Trade License, Emirates ID, and potentially a Memorandum of Association. See [Regional Requirements](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/regional-requirements#united-arab-emirates-uae) for full details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add your banking information">
    Choose how you want to receive payouts:
    - **Bank account** — Enter your account and routing number (US), IBAN (EU), sort code (UK), or local equivalent
    - **Debit card** — Add a Visa or Mastercard debit card (faster payouts in some countries)

    <Tip>
      If you're using **Wise** or **Payoneer** bank details, enter the bank account information provided by those services here.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify your identity">
    Upload a clear photo of your government-issued ID. Make sure:
    - All text is readable
    - All four corners are visible
    - There's no glare or blur

    Some countries require additional documents. For example, UAE requires a Trade License and Emirates ID. Stripe will prompt you for everything needed based on your country.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and submit">
    Review your information for accuracy, then submit. Stripe typically verifies accounts within 1-2 business days, though some countries (especially UAE and first-time accounts) may take 5-7 business days.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to BeatPass">
    After completing the Stripe setup, you'll be redirected back to BeatPass. Your **Finances** dashboard will show your account status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Setup

Once your account is verified, you'll see:

| Status | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| **Connected** | Your account is linked to BeatPass |
| **Charges Enabled** | You can receive payments |
| **Payouts Enabled** | Money can be transferred to your bank |

<Info>
  All three indicators should show green checkmarks. If any show warnings, click to see what additional information is needed.
</Info>

## Completing Pending Requirements

Sometimes Stripe needs additional verification. If you see pending requirements:

1. Go to your **Finances** dashboard
2. Click the **Complete setup** or warning indicator
3. Follow the prompts to provide additional information
4. Wait for Stripe to verify (usually 1-2 business days)

### Common Additional Requirements

- **Additional ID verification** — Stripe may request a second form of ID
- **Address verification** — A utility bill or bank statement showing your address
- **Tax information** — Tax forms or identification numbers

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I was redirected back but my status shows 'Setup Required'">
    You may not have completed all steps on Stripe. Click **Complete Setup** to continue where you left off.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My ID was rejected">
    Common reasons for rejection:
    - Photo is blurry or has glare
    - ID is expired
    - Not all corners are visible
    - Photo is of a photocopy, not the original
    
    Retake the photo in good lighting and try again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't see the setup button">
    Make sure you:
    - Are logged in to BeatPass
    - Have a producer profile created
    - Are viewing the Finances page (not another dashboard section)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The process is taking longer than expected">
    In rare cases, Stripe may take up to 5-7 business days for verification, especially for:
    - Accounts in certain countries (UAE, Japan, Singapore)
    - Cases requiring manual review
    - First-time Stripe users
    - Accounts requiring additional business documentation
    
    You'll receive an email from Stripe when your account is ready.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I already have a Stripe account — do I use it?">
    **No.** BeatPass creates a **Stripe Express** account for you, which is separate from any regular Stripe account you may have at stripe.com. During onboarding, Stripe creates a new Express account linked to BeatPass. Your existing Stripe account remains unchanged and separate.
    
    See [Accessing Your Stripe Dashboard](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/accessing-stripe-dashboard) for details on the difference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm trying to log into dashboard.stripe.com but don't see my BeatPass earnings">
    You're using the wrong login. BeatPass uses **Stripe Express** accounts, not regular Stripe accounts. To access your BeatPass payout dashboard:
    
    - Go to [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login)
    - Enter the email you used during BeatPass onboarding
    - Verify with a code sent to your phone or email
    
    See [Accessing Your Stripe Dashboard](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/accessing-stripe-dashboard) for full instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My country isn't in the list during onboarding">
    If your country isn't listed in the country selection dialog, you can still receive payouts using alternative methods:
    
    - **Wise** — Get US, EU, or UK bank details from [wise.com](https://wise.com)
    - **Payoneer** — Get receiving account details from [payoneer.com](https://www.payoneer.com)
    - **Stripe Atlas** — Incorporate a US company through [stripe.com/atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas)
    
    See [Unsupported Countries & Alternatives](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/unsupported-countries) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm in the UAE and the onboarding asks for business documents I don't have">
    The UAE requires a business-type account with a Trade License. If you don't have one, the most affordable option is a **freelancer permit** from a free zone like Sharjah Media City (Shams) — starting around AED 5,750/year (~\$1,565 USD).
    
    See [Regional Requirements — UAE](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/regional-requirements#united-arab-emirates-uae) for full details on obtaining a trade license or freelancer permit.
