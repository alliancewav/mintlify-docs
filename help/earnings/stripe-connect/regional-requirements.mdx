Stripe Connect onboarding requirements vary significantly by country. Some regions — such as the **UAE**, **Japan**, and **Singapore** — have additional regulatory requirements that make the process more involved than in countries like Canada or the US. This guide helps you prepare everything you need before starting.

<Info>
  BeatPass uses **Stripe-hosted onboarding**, which means Stripe will guide you through the required steps for your specific country. However, knowing what to expect in advance helps you gather documents and avoid delays.

---

## United Arab Emirates (UAE)

<Warning>
  The UAE has the **most complex onboarding requirements** of any BeatPass-supported country. Read this section carefully and prepare all documents before starting.
</Warning>

### Key Difference: Business Account Required

Unlike most countries where producers onboard as individuals, **the UAE only supports business-type accounts**. This means you need some form of business registration or freelancer permit to complete onboarding.

### Accepted Business Structures in the UAE

| Structure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sole Establishment** | A single-owner business licensed by a local emirate authority |
| **Free Zone Establishment** | A single-owner business registered in a UAE free zone |
| **LLC** | Limited Liability Company registered on the mainland |
| **Free Zone LLC** | LLC registered within a UAE free zone |

### Required Documents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trade License">
    A valid **Trade License** (also called a Commercial License) issued by the relevant UAE authority. This is mandatory for all business types.
    
    - Must be **current and not expired**
    - Stripe monitors expiration and requires renewal within 28 days of expiry
    - Freelancer permits from free zones (e.g., Dubai Creative Clusters, Sharjah Media City) count as trade licenses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identity Documents">
    You need to provide **multiple identity documents**:
    
    - **Passport** — Required for all individuals
    - **Emirates ID** — Required for UAE nationals and UAE residents
    - **Residence Visa** — Required for foreign nationals residing in the UAE
    
    All documents must be valid and not expired. Stripe checks expiration dates and will request renewals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Memorandum of Association (MOA)">
    Required for **all business types except sole establishments and free zone establishments**. This document shows the company's ownership structure, including all shareholders and their ownership percentages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proof of Bank Account Ownership">
    A document proving that the bank account belongs to the business. This can be:
    - A bank statement showing the business name
    - A bank letter confirming account ownership
    - A canceled cheque
  </Step>

  <Step title="Power of Attorney (if applicable)">
    If the person completing the Stripe onboarding (the company representative) is **not listed on the Trade License or MOA**, a notarized Power of Attorney or letter of authorization is required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Beneficial Ownership Disclosure

Stripe is required to verify **all individuals who own 25% or more** of the business. For each beneficial owner, you'll need to provide:

- Full name
- Date of birth
- Address
- Passport and Emirates ID (or Residence Visa for non-residents)

If a holding company owns 25%+ of the primary business, the MOA of both the holding company and the primary business must be uploaded.

### VAT Considerations

- Stripe charges **5% UAE VAT** on Stripe fees if you have **not** provided a valid UAE VAT ID
- If you provide a valid UAE VAT ID, Stripe fees are VAT-exempt but you may have self-assessment obligations
- Provide your VAT ID during onboarding to avoid unnecessary charges

### How UAE Producers Can Get a Trade License

If you're a music producer in the UAE without a trade license, here are common options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Freelancer Permit (Most Popular for Producers)">
    Several UAE free zones offer affordable freelancer permits suitable for music producers:
    
    - **Dubai Creative Clusters (formerly TECOM)** — Offers freelancer permits for media and creative professionals
    - **Sharjah Media City (Shams)** — One of the most affordable options, starting around AED 5,750/year (~$1,565 USD)
    - **Ajman Free Zone** — Budget-friendly freelancer licenses
    - **RAKEZ (Ras Al Khaimah)** — Competitive pricing for freelancer permits
    - **Dubai South** — Freelancer packages available
    
    These permits are recognized as trade licenses by Stripe and are sufficient to complete onboarding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instant/Virtual License">
    Some free zones offer instant or virtual licenses that can be obtained online in 24-48 hours:
    
    - **Dubai Economy & Tourism** — Instant license for AED 1,070/year (~$291 USD) — note: limited activity types
    - **IFZA (International Free Zone Authority)** — Quick online process
    
    Check that the license type covers "media production," "music," or "creative services" as an activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Full LLC Setup">
    For producers earning significant income, a full LLC may provide additional benefits:
    
    - Higher credibility
    - Ability to sponsor visas
    - More banking options
    - Cost ranges from AED 15,000-50,000/year (~$4,000-$13,600 USD) depending on the free zone
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Tip for UAE producers:** A free zone freelancer permit is the fastest and most affordable way to get onboarded with Stripe. Many producers use Sharjah Media City (Shams) or Dubai Creative Clusters as they cater specifically to media and creative professionals.

## General Tips for All Regions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prepare Documents First" icon="folder-open">
    Gather all required documents before starting the Stripe onboarding. The process goes much faster when you don't have to pause and search for documents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use High-Quality Photos" icon="camera">
    When uploading ID documents, ensure photos are clear, well-lit, and show all four corners. Avoid glare and blur.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Match Names Exactly" icon="check">
    Your name on Stripe must match your government ID exactly. Even small differences (like a middle name) can cause verification failures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep Documents Current" icon="calendar">
    Stripe monitors document expiration dates. You'll be notified when documents need renewal. Failing to update them can pause your payouts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Verification Timeline

| Scenario | Expected Time |
|----------|---------------|
| **Standard verification (US, Canada, UK, EU)** | 1-2 business days |
| **Additional document review** | 3-5 business days |
| **Complex cases (UAE, first-time accounts)** | 5-7 business days |
| **Manual review required** | Up to 14 business days |

<Tip>
  The verification process is fastest when all documents are provided upfront and are clear and legible. Incomplete submissions are the #1 cause of delays.
</Tip>
