## Alternative Payout Methods

If your country is not supported, here are four proven options used by international producers on BeatPass. Each option works by giving you bank account details in a **supported country**, which you then use during the Stripe Connect onboarding.

---

### Option 1: Wise Multi-Currency Account (Most Popular)

[Wise](https://wise.com) (formerly TransferWise) lets you open a multi-currency account with local bank details in the US, UK, EU, Australia, and other regions — even if you don't live there.

#### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Wise account">
    Sign up at [wise.com](https://wise.com) with your real identity and home address. Wise is available in 160+ countries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a USD, EUR, GBP, or CAD balance">
    Inside your Wise account, open a balance in one of BeatPass's supported currencies. Wise will give you **local bank details** for that currency (e.g., a US routing number and account number).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start BeatPass Stripe onboarding">
    When BeatPass asks you to select your country, choose the country that matches your Wise bank details (e.g., select **United States** if you have US bank details from Wise).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your Wise bank details">
    During the Stripe onboarding, enter the bank account details provided by Wise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive payouts and transfer locally">
    BeatPass payouts arrive in your Wise balance. From there, convert and transfer to your local bank account at Wise's competitive exchange rates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Wise Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Free or low-cost to open | Small fee for currency conversion (typically 0.4-1.5%) |
| Available in 160+ countries | Not available in a few sanctioned countries |
| Real bank details (not virtual) | May take 1-2 days for local transfers |
| Regulated financial institution | |
| Mobile app for easy management | |

<Tip>
  **Recommended for most producers.** Wise is the fastest and most affordable option. Many BeatPass producers in Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean use Wise successfully.
</Tip>

#### Important: Wise Account Verification

Wise will verify your identity before providing bank details. You'll need:
- A valid passport or national ID
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or similar)
- A selfie for identity verification

This process typically takes 1-3 business days.

---

### Option 2: Payoneer Receiving Account

[Payoneer](https://www.payoneer.com) provides receiving accounts with US, UK, EU, and other local bank details. It's widely used by freelancers and creators worldwide.

#### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Payoneer account">
    Sign up at [payoneer.com](https://www.payoneer.com). Payoneer is available in 190+ countries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request a Global Payment Service account">
    Inside Payoneer, activate the **Receive Payments** feature to get US or EU bank account details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Payoneer bank details during BeatPass onboarding">
    Select the country matching your Payoneer bank details, then enter those details during Stripe setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw to your local bank">
    Once payouts arrive in Payoneer, withdraw to your local bank account, mobile wallet, or Payoneer prepaid card.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Payoneer Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Available in 190+ countries | Higher fees than Wise (up to 2% for currency conversion) |
| Well-established, trusted platform | Annual fee for the Payoneer card |
| Multiple withdrawal options | Slower withdrawal times in some regions |
| Prepaid Mastercard available | |

### Option 3: Stripe Atlas (For Serious Producers)

[Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) helps you incorporate a **US company** (LLC or C-Corp) remotely from anywhere in the world. Once incorporated, you get a US business, a US bank account, and full Stripe access.

#### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply to Stripe Atlas">
    Visit [stripe.com/atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) and submit your application. You'll need your passport and basic information about your planned business.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stripe creates your US company">
    Atlas incorporates your company in Delaware, files all necessary paperwork, and opens a Mercury or Stripe Treasury bank account for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your US company for BeatPass onboarding">
    Select **United States** as your country during BeatPass onboarding and use your US company's bank details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage your company">
    Atlas provides a registered agent, EIN (tax ID), and initial legal templates. You'll need to file annual US tax returns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Stripe Atlas Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Full US business entity | \$500 one-time incorporation fee |
| Permanent Stripe access | Annual US tax filing required (~\$500-1,500/year for an accountant) |
| US bank account included | Delaware annual franchise tax (~\$300/year) |
| Professional credibility | More complex to manage |
| Access to US financial system | Overkill for producers earning small amounts |

<Warning>
  Stripe Atlas is recommended only for producers who earn (or expect to earn) significant income from BeatPass and other platforms. The ongoing costs of maintaining a US company may not make sense if your earnings are under \$500/month.
</Warning>

### Option 4: Trusted Contact in a Supported Country

If you have a trusted family member, friend, or business partner in a supported country, they can set up the Stripe Connect account on your behalf.

#### Important Considerations

- The person must use **their own real identity and bank account** — Stripe verifies all information
- You should have a **written agreement** about how funds will be forwarded to you
- The account holder is legally responsible for the Stripe account
- This option carries the most risk — only use it with someone you deeply trust
- Tax implications may apply to the account holder in their country

<Warning>
  BeatPass and Stripe require that the person who completes onboarding is the actual account holder. Misrepresenting identity during Stripe onboarding violates Stripe's Terms of Service and can result in account termination and loss of funds.
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is it allowed to use Wise or Payoneer bank details with Stripe?">
    Yes. Wise and Payoneer provide real bank account details in your name. Stripe accepts these as valid bank accounts for payouts. Many platforms and their users use this approach worldwide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I lose money on currency conversion?">
    There will be some conversion fees when you transfer from your Wise/Payoneer account to your local bank. Wise typically charges 0.4-1.5% depending on the currency pair. Payoneer charges up to 2%. These are generally much lower than traditional bank wire fees.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if Stripe adds support for my country later?">
    Unfortunately, your Stripe Connect account country **cannot be changed** after creation. If your country becomes supported, you would need to disconnect your current account and create a new one. Contact **contact@beatpass.ca** if this situation applies to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I switch from one alternative to another?">
    You can update the bank account in your Stripe Express dashboard at any time (through **Settings → Bank accounts**). So if you start with Payoneer and later prefer Wise, you can update your bank details without creating a new Stripe account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about tax obligations?">
    Tax obligations depend on your country of residence and the country where your alternative account is based. Consult a local tax advisor. For Stripe Atlas (US company), you will have US tax filing obligations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My country recently became supported by Stripe — what should I do?">
    If your country is now in BeatPass's supported list but you previously used an alternative method, contact **contact@beatpass.ca** to discuss options. You may be able to create a new account with your home country.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
