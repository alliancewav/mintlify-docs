## Required Information

During the Stripe onboarding process, you'll need to provide:

### Personal Information

- **Full legal name** — As it appears on your government ID
- **Date of birth** — Must match your ID exactly
- **Home address** — Your current residential address
- **Phone number** — A number where Stripe can reach you if needed

### Banking Information

Choose one of the following to receive payouts:

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Bank Account** | Account number and routing number (US) or equivalent for your country |
| **Debit Card** | Visa or Mastercard debit card linked to your bank account |

</Info>

### Identity Verification

Stripe requires identity verification to comply with financial regulations. You'll need:

- **Government-issued photo ID** — One of the following:
  - Driver's license
  - Passport
  - National ID card
  - State/Province ID

<Note>
  Your ID must be valid (not expired) and clearly legible. Take photos in good lighting without glare.
</Note>

## Country-Specific Requirements

Requirements vary by country. Common additional requirements include:

| Country | Additional Requirements |
|---------|------------------------|
| **United States** | Social Security Number (SSN) or ITIN |
| **Canada** | Social Insurance Number (SIN) |
| **United Kingdom** | National Insurance Number |
| **European Union** | Tax identification number for your country |

<Tip>
  Don't worry if you're unsure what's required for your country—Stripe will guide you through exactly what's needed during the setup process.
</Tip>

## Business vs. Individual

BeatPass creates individual (personal) Stripe accounts by default. If you want to receive payments as a business entity:

1. Complete the initial setup as an individual
2. Contact Stripe support to convert to a business account
3. Provide additional business documentation as requested

Most producers use individual accounts, which are simpler to set up and maintain.

## Supported Countries

Stripe Connect is available in 40+ countries. If you're unsure whether your country is supported, check [Stripe's supported countries list](https://stripe.com/global).

<Warning>
  If you're in a country not supported by Stripe, you won't be able to receive payouts from BeatPass at this time.
</Warning>
