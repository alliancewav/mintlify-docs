## Required Information

During the Stripe onboarding process, you'll need to provide:

### Personal Information

- **Full legal name** — As it appears on your government ID
- **Date of birth** — Must match your ID exactly
- **Home address** — Your current residential address

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Bank Account** | Account number and routing number (US) or equivalent for your country |
| **Debit Card** | Visa or Mastercard debit card linked to your bank account |

Stripe requires identity verification to comply with financial regulations. You'll need:

- **Government-issued photo ID** — One of the following:
  - Driver's license
  - Passport
  - National ID card
  - State/Province ID

<Note>
  Your ID must be valid (not expired) and clearly legible. Take photos in good lighting without glare.
</Note>

## Country-Specific Requirements

Requirements vary by country. Common additional requirements include:

| Country / Region | Additional Requirements |
|---------|------------------------|
| **United States** | Social Security Number (SSN) or ITIN |
| **Canada** | Social Insurance Number (SIN) |
| **United Kingdom** | National Insurance Number (NINO) |
| **European Union** | Tax identification number for your country (TIN, NIF, Steuer-ID, etc.) |

### UAE Producers — Important

<Warning>
  The **UAE requires a business-type account** — individual accounts are not supported. You will need a **Trade License** (or freelancer permit from a free zone) and additional documents. Affordable freelancer permits are available from free zones like Sharjah Media City (Shams), Dubai Creative Clusters, and RAKEZ.
</Warning>

## Business vs. Individual

Most countries allow producers to onboard as **individuals** (personal accounts), which is the simplest option.

However, some countries **require a business account**:

| Country | Account Type |
|---------|-------------|
| **Most countries** | Individual (default) |
| **UAE** | Business only (sole establishment, free zone establishment, LLC, or free zone LLC) |

If you're in a country that supports individual accounts but want to receive payments as a business entity:

1. Complete the initial setup as an individual
2. Contact Stripe support to convert to a business account
3. Provide additional business documentation as requested

## Supported Countries

BeatPass supports Stripe Connect in **43 countries** across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East.

### Country Not Supported?

If your country isn't listed, you can still receive payouts through alternative methods like **Wise**, **Payoneer**, or **Stripe Atlas**. The BeatPass onboarding screen shows these options when your country isn't directly supported.
