## Why You Need Stripe Connect

Without a connected Stripe account:

- You cannot receive subscription revenue shares
- You cannot receive exclusive beat sale proceeds
- Your earnings share is redistributed to other eligible producers

<Warning>
  Until your Stripe account is fully set up and verified, you will not receive any payouts from BeatPass.
</Warning>

## Revenue Streams Enabled

Once your Stripe account is connected, you can receive earnings from:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Subscription Revenue** | Monthly payouts based on your tracks' contribution value |
