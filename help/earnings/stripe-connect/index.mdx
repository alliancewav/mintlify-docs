Stripe Connect is the payment infrastructure that powers all producer payouts on BeatPass. By connecting a Stripe account, you enable automatic deposits of your earnings directly to your bank account.

## What is Stripe Connect?

Stripe is a trusted global payment processor used by millions of businesses worldwide. Stripe Connect allows BeatPass to securely send your earnings directly to you without handling your banking information.

## Why You Need Stripe Connect

Without a connected Stripe account:

- You cannot receive subscription revenue shares
- You cannot receive exclusive beat sale proceeds
- Your earnings share is redistributed to other eligible producers

<Warning>
  Until your Stripe account is fully set up and verified, you will not receive any payouts from BeatPass.
</Warning>

## Revenue Streams Enabled

Once your Stripe account is connected, you can receive earnings from:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Subscription Revenue** | Monthly payouts based on your tracks' contribution value |
| **Exclusive Sales** | Direct payments when someone purchases exclusive rights to your beat |

## Stripe Express — Not Regular Stripe

<Warning>
  BeatPass uses **Stripe Express** accounts. This is different from a regular Stripe account at stripe.com. If you already have a regular Stripe account, your BeatPass payout account is **separate**. Do not try to log into dashboard.stripe.com to view your BeatPass earnings — use the Express login at [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) instead.
</Warning>

For a full explanation of the difference and how to log in, see [Accessing Your Stripe Dashboard](/help/earnings/stripe-connect/accessing-stripe-dashboard).

## Supported Countries

BeatPass supports Stripe Connect in **43 countries** across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. Some countries (like the UAE) have additional requirements such as a trade license or freelancer permit.

If your country isn't supported, alternatives like **Wise**, **Payoneer**, and **Stripe Atlas** can help you receive payouts. The BeatPass onboarding screen shows these options automatically.
