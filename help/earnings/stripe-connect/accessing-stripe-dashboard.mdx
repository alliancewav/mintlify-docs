BeatPass uses **Stripe Express** accounts for producer payouts. This is different from a regular Stripe account. Many producers get confused between the two — this guide clears everything up.

---

## Stripe Express vs. Regular Stripe

This is the most common point of confusion. BeatPass creates a **Stripe Express** account for you — it is **not** the same as a standard Stripe account you might create at stripe.com.

| | **Stripe Express (Your BeatPass Account)** | **Regular Stripe (stripe.com)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Receive payouts from platforms like BeatPass | Run your own business, charge customers directly |
| **Login URL** | [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) | [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com) |
| **Authentication** | Email + SMS/email code (no password) | Email + password |
| **Who creates it** | BeatPass creates it for you during onboarding | You create it yourself at stripe.com |
| **What you see** | Simplified dashboard: balance, payouts, transactions | Full Stripe dashboard with all business tools |

<Warning>
  **Do not try to log into dashboard.stripe.com to view your BeatPass payouts.** Your BeatPass payout account is a Stripe Express account with a separate login. Even if you have a personal Stripe account, your BeatPass earnings are managed through the Express account.
</Warning>

## How to Access Your Stripe Express Dashboard

There are two ways to access your Stripe Express dashboard:

### Option 1: Through BeatPass (Recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your Producer Dashboard">
    Click your **profile avatar** in the top navigation, then select **Backstage**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Finances section">
    Click **Finances** in your Producer Dashboard navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'View Stripe Dashboard'">
    If your account is connected, you'll see a link to access your Stripe Express dashboard. This generates a secure one-time login link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Direct Login at Stripe Express

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Express login page">
    Visit [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) in your browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your email address">
    Use the **same email** you used when setting up Stripe Connect through BeatPass.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify with a code">
    Stripe sends a verification code to your phone (SMS) or email. Enter the code to log in. **There is no password** — Express accounts use one-time codes for security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your dashboard">
    Once verified, you'll see your Express Dashboard with your balance, payouts, and transaction history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Only **live mode** accounts can log into Stripe Express directly. If your account was just created and hasn't processed any transactions yet, use the BeatPass link method (Option 1) instead.
</Info>

## What You Can Do in the Express Dashboard

Once logged in, you can:

- **View your balance** — See your total balance, money on the way to your bank, and money available soon
- **Check payout history** — See when and how much was transferred to your bank
- **View transactions** — See all payments received from BeatPass
- **Update bank details** — Change your payout bank account or debit card
- **Manage payout schedule** — Switch between automatic and manual payouts
- **Handle disputes** — Respond to any payment disputes
- **View tax forms** — Access 1099 or other tax documents (US producers)

## "I Already Have a Stripe Account"

If you already have a regular Stripe account (e.g., for your own online store):

- **Your BeatPass Express account is separate.** It does not merge with or appear inside your regular Stripe dashboard.
- **You use different login URLs.** Regular Stripe: `dashboard.stripe.com`. BeatPass Express: `connect.stripe.com/express_login`.
- **They can share the same email.** Having both accounts on the same email is fine — they are treated as independent accounts by Stripe.
- **Earnings stay separate.** Your BeatPass payouts go to whichever bank account you configured during the Express onboarding, not your regular Stripe account's bank.

<Tip>
  If you use the same email for both accounts, bookmark the Express login page to avoid accidentally going to the wrong dashboard.

## Troubleshooting Login Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm logging into dashboard.stripe.com but don't see my BeatPass earnings">
    You're logging into the wrong dashboard. Your BeatPass account is a **Stripe Express** account. Go to [connect.stripe.com/express_login](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) instead, or access it through your BeatPass Finances page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm not receiving the verification code">
    - Check your **spam/junk** folder if the code is sent by email
    - Ensure your phone number is correct and can receive SMS
    - Wait 60 seconds before requesting a new code
    - If you changed your phone number, contact **contact@beatpass.ca** for assistance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="It says 'No account found' when I try to log in">
    - Make sure you're using the **exact same email** you used during the BeatPass Stripe onboarding
    - Check for typos in your email address
    - If you haven't completed the Stripe Connect setup on BeatPass, your Express account may not exist yet — go to **Finances** in your Producer Dashboard to start the setup
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I created a regular Stripe account instead of using the BeatPass onboarding">
    Creating a regular Stripe account at stripe.com does **not** connect you to BeatPass. You must use the **Connect Stripe Account** button in your BeatPass Finances dashboard. This creates the proper Express account linked to BeatPass.
    
    Your independently created Stripe account will remain separate and won't receive BeatPass payouts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I convert my Express account to a full Stripe account?">
    No. Stripe Express accounts are managed by the platform (BeatPass) and cannot be converted to standard Stripe accounts. If you need a full Stripe account for other business purposes, create one separately at stripe.com.
  </Accordion>
