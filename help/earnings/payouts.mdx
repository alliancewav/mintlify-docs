## Revenue Share Model

### How Revenue is Split

Producers earn from **subscription revenue splits** and **direct license sales**. BeatPass adds a platform fee (for example, 15%) on top of prices and does not deduct that fee from your listed license price. However, standard Stripe processing fees apply and are deducted before funds reach your Stripe Connect account.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Subscription Pool" icon="users">
    A portion of each paid subscription invoice is allocated to a producer pool based on the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula).
    
    *BeatPass also charges a platform fee (for example, 15%) on top, paid by the subscriber and retained by BeatPass.*
    
    <Note>Only fully paid, active subscriptions contribute to the pool. We strictly validate all payments to ensure the pool is real revenue.</Note>
  </Card>
  <Card title="License Sales" icon="file-contract">
    You receive the price you set for a license **minus Stripe processing fees**.
    
    *BeatPass charges a separate platform fee on top, paid by the buyer and kept by BeatPass*.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  In both revenue streams, BeatPass adds a platform fee on top for the customer and retains that fee. For **subscription revenue splits**, the producer pool is calculated on the full base subscription amount and Stripe processing fees on the subscription charge are effectively covered from BeatPass’s side (for example, out of the platform fee). For **direct license sales**, standard Stripe processing fees are deducted from your portion before funds reach your Stripe Connect account. In both cases, additional Stripe fees may apply when funds are ultimately paid out from Stripe to your bank.
</Tip>

Your share of the subscription pool is calculated by the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula) based on plays, time decay, and collaboration splits.

## Payout Flow

### The Complete Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Earn Revenue">
    Revenue accumulates from:
    - **License sales** — Earnings from exclusive purchases via Stripe Connect (you receive your listed price minus Stripe processing fees; BeatPass keeps a separate platform fee charged to the buyer)
    - **Contribution earnings** — Your share of the subscription revenue pool based on the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula), funded from each paid subscription invoice
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Funds Reach Your Stripe Account">
    - License sales: Funds transfer after payment succeeds
    - Contribution splits: Processed after each successful subscription invoice (`invoice.paid`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stripe Holds Funds">
    Stripe holds funds in your connected account balance:
    - **Available balance** — Ready for payout
    - **Pending balance** — Processing (typically 2-7 days)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payout Initiated">
    Stripe automatically initiates payouts to your bank:
    - Default: Daily automatic payouts (when balance available)
    - Can be configured to weekly or monthly in Stripe Dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bank Receives Funds">
    Funds arrive in your linked bank account:
    - US: 1-2 business days
    - Canada: 2-3 business days
    - International: 3-7 business days
  </Step>
</Steps>
