BeatPass uses Stripe to handle all payment processing and payouts. Once your earnings reach your Stripe balance, Stripe automatically transfers them to your bank account on a regular schedule.

## How Payouts Work

There are two types of earnings, and each follows a slightly different path:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Subscription Revenue" icon="repeat">
    Monthly revenue sharing payments calculated at the end of each billing cycle based on your contribution value.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Sales" icon="shopping-bag">
    Exclusive beat purchases and track sales are transferred to your balance immediately after the transaction.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Stripe Automatic Payouts

Once money reaches your Stripe balance, Stripe automatically transfers it to your bank account. The timing depends on your country:

| Region | Typical Payout Speed |
|--------|---------------------|
| **United States** | 2 business days |
| **Canada** | 2 business days |
| **United Kingdom** | 2 business days |
| **European Union** | 2-3 business days |
| **Other countries** | 3-7 business days |

<Info>
  Payout speed can vary based on your bank and account history. New accounts may experience slightly longer processing times initially.

## Subscription Revenue Schedule

Subscription revenue splits are calculated monthly when each subscriber's billing cycle renews:

1. **Subscriber pays** — When a subscription payment is processed
2. **Revenue is split** — Your share is calculated based on contribution values
3. **Transfer is initiated** — Funds are sent to your Stripe balance
4. **Payout to bank** — Stripe sends money to your bank within 2-7 business days

<Note>
  Because subscribers have different billing dates, you may receive multiple smaller payouts throughout the month rather than one large monthly payment.
</Note>

## Direct Sales Schedule

When someone purchases an exclusive beat or track:

1. **Purchase completed** — The buyer pays for the track
2. **Payment is processed** — Stripe processes the transaction
3. **Funds reach your balance** — After a brief processing period
4. **Automatic payout** — Stripe transfers to your bank on the next payout cycle

## Viewing Your Payouts

You can track all payouts in your **Finances** dashboard:

- **Total Balance** — Current balance in your Stripe account
- **Future Payouts** — Scheduled transfers not yet sent
- **In Transit** — Money currently being transferred to your bank
- **Lifetime Volume** — Total amount you've earned on the platform

## Payout Statuses

Your subscription revenue splits will show one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Split has been calculated and is queued for transfer to your Stripe balance |
| **Paid** | Money has been transferred to your Stripe balance (look for it under **Future Payouts** in Finances) |
| **Failed** | Stripe attempted to transfer funds but hit an error; BeatPass automatically retries and surfaces the failure reason |
| **Excluded** | You did not have a fully enabled Stripe Connect account (Connected + Charges Enabled + Payouts Enabled) when the split ran, so your share was redistributed |

<Info>
  If a split fails, BeatPass will retry up to 5 times and record the retry count/failure reason (visible in Finances). Fix the underlying bank or Stripe account issue, then the next retry will succeed automatically.
</Info>

### Redistribution Bonuses

- When another producer is **excluded**, their portion is redistributed among eligible producers.
- Your Finances dashboard shows this as a **Redistribution bonus** field on each split.
- Bonuses are calculated per split, so amounts can vary each month depending on how many producers were excluded.

### Excluded Splits

When your status is **Excluded**:

1. The split entry remains in your history so you know what was missed.
2. Funds are permanently redirected—there is no back pay for past excluded splits.
3. Fix your Stripe Connect status (usually by completing verification) to ensure future splits succeed.

## Minimum Payout Threshold

Stripe requires a minimum balance of **\$10 USD** (or equivalent) before initiating a payout. If your balance is below this amount, it will accumulate until the threshold is reached.

## Bank Holidays and Weekends

- Payouts are only processed on business days
- Transfers initiated on Friday may not arrive until Tuesday
- Bank holidays may delay receipt by 1-2 additional days

<Tip>
  For the fastest payouts, connect a debit card instead of a bank account. Debit card payouts can arrive within minutes in some countries.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Delayed Payouts

If your payout seems delayed:

1. **Check your Stripe account status** — Make sure payouts are enabled
2. **Verify your bank details** — Incorrect information can cause delays
3. **Consider the timing** — Weekends and holidays affect processing
4. **Review for holds** — Stripe may temporarily hold funds for new accounts
