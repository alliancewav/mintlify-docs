## Overview

The contribution formula determines how platform subscription revenue is distributed among producers. Your share is calculated based on a transparent formula that rewards engagement while accounting for time and collaboration.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Producers
</Info>

---

## How It Works

### The Contribution Pool

For each paid subscription invoice, BeatPass allocates a portion of the base subscription price to the **contribution pool**. In dashboards this is often shown as a monthly pool, but under the hood it is built invoice-by-invoice as Stripe fires `invoice.paid` events.

The pool represents subscription revenue available to producers before any downstream Stripe payout fees. Your share is distributed based on your **contribution value** relative to all producers.

```
Your Payout = (Your Contribution Value / Total Contribution Value) × Pool Amount
```

---

## The Formula

BeatPass uses the following formula to calculate each track's contribution value:

```
C = Time Decay × Popularity Boost × Collaboration Split
```

### Formula Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time Decay" defaultOpen icon="clock">
    **Formula**: `exp(-(ln(2)/6) × Δt)`

    Tracks naturally decay over time with a **6-month half-life**. This ensures newer content stays competitive while older catalog still earns.

    - **Δt** = Months since upload
    - After 6 months → 50% value
    - After 12 months → 25% value
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Popularity Boost" icon="fire">
    **Formula**: `1 + 2 × (log₁₀(1+P) / (log₁₀(1+P)+1))`

    A logarithmic curve that rewards popular tracks while preventing dominance. Scales from **1× to 3×** based on total plays.

    - **P** = Total plays/streams
    - Uses logarithmic scaling (diminishing returns)
    - Maximum boost caps at 3×
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collaboration Split" icon="users">
    **Formula**: `1 / Np`

    When multiple producers are credited, contribution divides equally among them.

    - **Np** = Number of credited producers
    - Solo track = 100%
    - 2 producers = 50% each
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Each Factor Works

### Time Decay Curve

Newer tracks contribute more than older ones—but your catalog never stops earning entirely.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fresh (0-3 months)">
    **100% → 71%** — Maximum contribution window. New releases have the strongest earning potential.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Established (3-6 months)">
    **71% → 50%** — Still strong earners. This is when a track proves its staying power.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Catalog (6-12 months)">
    **50% → 25%** — Reduced but steady. High-quality tracks continue earning passively.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Legacy (12+ months)">
    **25% → lower** — Long-tail earnings. A large catalog accumulates meaningful value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Strategy**: Consistent uploads help maintain your contribution value. Aim for 2-4 quality releases per month to keep your fresh track pipeline full.
</Tip>

### Popularity Boost Curve

Tracks with more plays receive a logarithmic boost—rewarding success without letting mega-hits dominate everything.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Starting Out (0-100 plays)">
    **1.0× → 2.3×** — Quick initial boost rewards early traction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Growing (100-1,000 plays)">
    **2.3× → 2.7×** — Steady gains as your track proves its appeal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Popular (1,000-10,000 plays)">
    **2.7× → 3.0×** — Approaching maximum boost.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Viral (10,000+ plays)">
    **3.0× (max)** — Cap ensures no single track dominates the pool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The logarithmic curve means **your first 100 plays matter more than your next 1,000**. Focus on quality and discoverability over chasing viral numbers.
</Info>

### Collaboration Economics

When multiple producers collaborate, contribution splits equally—but strategic collaborations can actually boost total earnings:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Solo Track" icon="user">
    **100%** of contribution value

    Full earnings, but limited to your audience reach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaboration" icon="users">
    **50-33%** each (split by producers)

    Lower per-person share, but combined audiences may generate more total plays—and the popularity boost can offset the split.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **When to collaborate**: If your collaborator brings a significantly larger audience, the popularity boost from their reach can make your 50% share worth more than 100% of a solo track.
</Tip>

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: New Solo Track

**Track Details**: Uploaded today, 500 plays, 1 producer

| Factor           | Calculation      | Value    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| Time Decay       | exp(0)           | 1.0      |
| Popularity       | 1 + 2×(2.7/3.7)  | ~2.46    |
| Collaboration    | 1/1              | 1.0      |
| **Contribution** | 1.0 × 2.46 × 1.0 | **2.46** |

### Example 2: Older Collaborative Track

**Track Details**: 6 months old, 2,000 plays, 2 producers

| Factor           | Calculation        | Value                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Time Decay       | exp(-0.693)        | 0.50                     |
| Popularity       | 1 + 2×(3.3/4.3)    | ~2.54                    |
| Collaboration    | 1/2                | 0.50                     |
| **Contribution** | 0.50 × 2.54 × 0.50 | **0.635** (per producer) |

### Example 3: Payout Calculation

**Scenario**: The contribution pool for a given period (for example, the sum of eligible subscription invoices in a month, before any additional payout-related Stripe fees) is \$10,000. Total platform contribution is 5,000 points.

| Producer   | Total Contribution | Share % | Payout |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Producer A | 250 points         | 5.0%    | \$500  |
| Producer B | 100 points         | 2.0%    | \$200  |
| Producer C | 50 points          | 1.0%    | \$100  |

```
Producer A Payout = (250 / 5,000) × $10,000 = $500
```

<Note>
  These are simplified examples. Actual payouts depend on the total pool size, all producers' combined contribution values, and Stripe processing/payout fees.
</Note>

### Direct Sales vs Contribution

BeatPass offers two distinct revenue streams. Smart producers leverage both:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="License Sales" icon="money-bill">
    **You set the price; buyers pay your price plus a platform fee**

    - BeatPass adds a platform fee on top and keeps that fee
    - Standard Stripe processing fees are deducted from your portion before funds reach your Stripe Connect account
    - Works best for premium/exclusive beats
    - Great for established brands
    - Example: $150 beat → you receive slightly less than $150 after Stripe fees
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contribution Earnings" icon="chart-line">
    **Passive income from streaming**

    - Recurring revenue as long as subscribers keep paying
    - Works best for high-volume catalogs
    - Rewards engagement quality
    - Example: A 5% share of a $10K contribution pool for a given period → $500 allocated to you before any payout-related Stripe fees
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Best strategy**: Use contribution earnings as your baseline income, and license sales for bonus payouts. A producer with 50 active tracks earning $200/month in contribution **plus** 2-3 license sales at $100-300 each has diversified, stable income.
</Tip>

| Subscription splits processed | Shortly after each `invoice.paid` event via the subscription split job; payouts to Stripe Connect and then your bank follow your Stripe payout schedule |
