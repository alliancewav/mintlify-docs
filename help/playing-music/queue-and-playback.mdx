# Queue & Playback

The queue is your personal playlist of upcoming tracks. Build it as you browse, and BeatPass plays them in order—or shuffled, if you prefer.

## Opening the Queue

To view your current queue:

1. Click the **queue icon** in the player bar (right side, looks like stacked lines)
2. The queue panel slides open on the right side of your screen

The queue panel shows:

- **Track count** — Total number of tracks in your queue
- **Now Playing** — The current track highlighted at the top
- **Up Next** — All upcoming tracks in order

## Adding Tracks to the Queue

### Add a Single Track

1. Right-click on any track (or long-press on mobile)
2. Select **Add to queue** from the context menu
3. The track is added to the end of your queue

### Play a Track Immediately

- Click the play button on any track to start it immediately
- Your current queue is replaced with the new context (album, playlist, etc.)

### Add from Albums or Playlists

When you right-click an album or playlist, you can add all its tracks to your queue at once.

## Managing Your Queue

### Play Any Track

Click on any track in the queue to jump to it immediately. The queue continues from that point.

### Shuffle the Queue

Click the shuffle button in the queue panel header (or in the main player controls):

- **Shuffle icon** — Normal order
- **Highlighted shuffle icon** — Shuffled order

When shuffle is on, tracks play in random order. Turn it off to return to the original order.

### Clear or Modify

Currently playing tracks are highlighted. The queue updates automatically as you:

- Play new content
- Add tracks via context menu
- Skip to different tracks

## Now Playing Section

The top of the queue panel shows:

- **Track artwork** — Thumbnail of the current track
- **Track name** — The title of what's playing
- **Producer** — Who made the beat
- **Visual indicator** — Shows the track is currently playing

## Queue Behavior

### When You Play Something New

Playing a track, album, or playlist replaces your current queue with the new content. The track you clicked starts playing immediately.

### When You Add to Queue

Using **Add to queue** appends tracks to your existing queue without interrupting playback.

### Continuous Playback

The player automatically advances to the next track when one finishes, unless:

- You've reached the end of the queue (and repeat is off)
- You've paused playback
- You've closed the browser tab

## Repeat Modes

Control what happens when your queue finishes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Off** | Playback stops after the last track |
| **Repeat All** | Queue loops back to the beginning |
| **Repeat One** | Current track repeats indefinitely |

Click the repeat button to cycle through these modes.

## Mobile Queue

On mobile, access the queue from the expanded player:

1. Tap the mini player bar to expand
2. Tap the queue icon in the top-right
3. The queue panel slides in
4. Tap outside or use the back arrow to close

The mobile queue shows the same information with touch-optimized controls.

<Tip>
Build your perfect session by adding tracks while browsing. Your queue stays intact as you explore different pages, genres, and producers.
