# Track Comments

BeatPass lets you leave comments at specific timestamps on a track's waveform. This creates conversations around particular moments—a hard-hitting drop, a unique sound, or a section that caught your attention.

## How Timed Comments Work

Unlike regular comments that appear below a track, **timed comments** are attached to specific moments in the audio:

- Comments appear as small avatar icons on the waveform
- Each comment is positioned at the exact timestamp where it was left
- Hover over an avatar to read the comment

## Viewing Comments

When you visit a track page:

1. Look at the waveform visualization
2. Small circular avatars appear at various positions along the waveform
3. Each avatar represents a comment left at that timestamp
4. **Hover** over an avatar to see a popup with:
   - The commenter's name
   - Their comment text

## Leaving a Comment

To leave a timed comment on a track:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    You must be logged in to leave comments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on the Waveform">
    Click anywhere on the waveform where you want to leave your comment. A marker appears showing your avatar at that position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type Your Comment">
    A comment input field appears. Type your comment about that specific moment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Press Enter or click the submit button to post your comment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your comment now appears as an avatar icon at that position on the waveform for everyone to see.

## Comment Guidelines

When leaving comments:

- **Be specific** — Reference what you hear at that moment ("This snare hits different!")
- **Be constructive** — Helpful feedback is always appreciated
- **Be respectful** — Keep the community positive for everyone

## Who Can Comment

- **Logged-in users** can leave comments on tracks
- **Anyone** can view existing comments by hovering over avatars on the waveform

<Note>
If you're not logged in, you can still see comment avatars on the waveform and read them by hovering, but you won't be able to leave your own comments.
</Note>

## Why Use Timed Comments?

Timed comments are great for:

- **Highlighting favorite moments** — "This drop at 1:23 is fire 🔥"
- **Giving producers feedback** — "Love how the 808 slides here"
- **Starting conversations** — Other users can see your comment and respond
- **Discovering details** — See what moments others found interesting

## Mobile Experience

On mobile devices:

- Comment avatars are visible on the waveform
- Tap an avatar to view the comment
- Tap on the waveform to position your comment marker
- Use the comment field below to type and submit

<Tip>
Pay attention to areas with multiple comment avatars—they often mark the best parts of a track that other listeners loved.
