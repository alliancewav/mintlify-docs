# Player Controls

The BeatPass player gives you full control over your listening experience. Here's how to use each control.

## Main Playback Controls

The center of the player bar contains the primary playback buttons:

### Play / Pause

- **Play** — Click the play button (▶) to start or resume playback
- **Pause** — Click the pause button (⏸) to pause the current track

The button toggles between these two states depending on whether music is playing.

### Previous / Next

- **Previous** (⏮) — Go back to the previous track in your queue
- **Next** (⏭) — Skip to the next track in your queue

<Tip>
If you're more than a few seconds into a track, clicking **Previous** first restarts the current track. Click it again quickly to go to the actual previous track.
</Tip>

### Shuffle

The shuffle button randomizes the order of tracks in your queue:

- **Off** — Tracks play in their original order
- **On** (highlighted) — Tracks play in random order

Click the shuffle icon to toggle between these modes. When active, the icon appears highlighted in your theme's accent color.

### Repeat

The repeat button cycles through three modes:

1. **Off** — Queue plays once, then stops
2. **Repeat All** — After the last track, playback loops back to the first
3. **Repeat One** — The current track repeats continuously

The icon changes to show which mode is active:
- Normal icon = Off
- Highlighted icon = Repeat All
- Icon with "1" indicator = Repeat One

## Seekbar and Time

The seekbar shows your position in the current track:

- **Current time** — Displayed on the left (e.g., "1:45")
- **Progress bar** — Visual representation of how far through the track you are
- **Total duration** — Displayed on the right (e.g., "3:30")

### Seeking

To jump to a specific part of a track:

1. Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that position
2. Or drag the progress indicator to scrub through the track

## Volume Controls

Volume controls appear on the right side of the player bar (desktop only):

### Volume Slider

- Drag the slider left to decrease volume
- Drag right to increase volume
- The slider shows your current volume level

### Mute / Unmute

Click the speaker icon to toggle mute:

- **Speaker icon** — Audio is playing (click to mute)
- **Muted speaker icon** — Audio is muted (click to unmute)

The icon changes based on your current volume level:
- Low volume = single sound wave
- High volume = multiple sound waves
- Muted = crossed-out speaker
