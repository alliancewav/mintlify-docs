# Lyrics

Some tracks on BeatPass include lyrics that you can view while listening. This feature is especially useful for vocal samples, hooks, or reference tracks.

## Viewing Lyrics

To open the lyrics view:

1. Play a track that has lyrics available
2. Click the **microphone icon** in the player bar
3. The lyrics appear in a full-screen overlay

### What You'll See

The lyrics view displays:

- **Track artwork** — Large album art on the left (desktop)
- **Track name** — Title of the current track
- **Producer name** — Who created the beat
- **Lyrics text** — The full lyrics in an easy-to-read format

### Closing the Lyrics View

Click the **X** button in the top corner or click outside the lyrics area to close and return to your previous view.

## Lyrics Availability

Not all tracks have lyrics available. This depends on:

- Whether the producer uploaded lyrics with the track
- Whether the track contains vocals or is instrumental-only

### When Lyrics Aren't Available

If you open the lyrics view for a track without lyrics, you'll see:

> "We do not have lyrics for this song yet"
> 
> Please try again later

This means the producer hasn't added lyrics for this particular track.

## Desktop vs. Mobile

### Desktop

On desktop, the lyrics view opens as a full-screen overlay with:

- Album artwork displayed prominently on the left
- Lyrics scrollable on the right
- Track info centered below the artwork

### Mobile

On mobile, tap the microphone icon in the expanded player to view lyrics. The layout is optimized for smaller screens with scrollable text.

<Note>
Most beats on BeatPass are instrumentals and may not include lyrics. The lyrics feature is primarily useful for tracks that contain vocal samples, hooks, or sung/rapped sections.

## For Producers

If you're a producer and want to add lyrics to your tracks:

1. Go to your track's edit page in the Backstage
2. Find the lyrics field
3. Enter your lyrics text
4. Save your changes

Lyrics will then be available for listeners who play your track.
