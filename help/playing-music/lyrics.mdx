## Writing Lyrics

### Starting Fresh

When you open the lyrics panel for a track that doesn't have lyrics yet, you'll see an empty state with a **Start Writing** button. Click it to begin writing.

### The Lyrics Editor

The editor provides tools designed for songwriting:

- **Line-by-line editing** — Each line is separate for easy organization
- **Section markers** — Add structure with Intro, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Hook, Bridge, Outro, and Ad-libs sections
- **Rhyme highlighting** — Rhyming words are automatically color-coded to help you see patterns
- **Syllable counting** — Track syllable counts for rhythm and flow
- **Bar counter** — If the beat has BPM information, see bar and beat positions in real-time

### Adding Song Sections

To organize your lyrics with sections:

1. Click the **Section** dropdown in the toolbar
2. Select the section type (Verse, Chorus, etc.)
3. The section marker is inserted at your cursor position

Sections are color-coded for visual distinction — Verses appear green, Choruses purple, Hooks pink, and so on.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter** — Create a new line
- **Backspace** at start of line — Merge with previous line or delete empty line
- **Ctrl/Cmd + T** — Insert timestamp at current playback position (synced mode)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Z** — Undo
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z** — Redo

## Synced Lyrics

For a karaoke-style experience, you can sync your lyrics to the beat's timing.

### Enabling Sync Mode

1. Click the **edit icon** to enter edit mode
2. Toggle **Synced lyrics** on
3. An **Auto** button appears for automatic timestamping

### Adding Timestamps

There are two ways to add timestamps:

**Manual method:**
- Position playback where you want the line to start
- Click the timestamp button in the toolbar to insert `[MM:SS]` at the current line

**Auto mode:**
- Enable the **Auto** button
- As you press Enter to create new lines, timestamps are automatically inserted at the current playback position

### Timestamp Format

Timestamps use the format `[MM:SS]` (minutes:seconds). For example:
```
[00:15] First line starts here
[00:20] Second line follows
[00:25] And so on...
```

### Playback Experience

When viewing synced lyrics (not editing):

- **Active line highlighting** — The current line is enlarged and prominent
- **Auto-scroll** — The view automatically scrolls to keep the current line centered
- **Click to seek** — Click any timestamped line to jump to that position in the track
- **Past/upcoming styling** — Lines that have played appear faded, upcoming lines are dimmed

## Saving Your Lyrics

### Auto-Save

Your lyrics are automatically saved as you write. The editor uses a smart save system that:
- Saves your changes a few seconds after you stop typing
- Automatically retries if the save fails due to a temporary issue
- Respects rate limits to avoid overwhelming the server

You'll also get an auto-save when you close the lyrics panel, switch to a different track, or exit edit mode.

### Manual Save

Click the **Save** button to explicitly save your work. You'll see a confirmation when saved successfully.

### Deleting Lyrics

To delete lyrics for a track:
1. Enter edit mode
2. Clear all the text
3. Click **Delete** (the Save button changes to Delete when empty)

Or use the **More** menu (three dots) and select **Delete lyrics**.

## Your Lyrics Library

All lyrics you've written are saved to your personal library.

### Accessing Your Library

1. Click **Library** in the left sidebar
2. Select **Lyrics** from the Library menu

### Library Features

The lyrics library page shows:

- **All your saved lyrics** — Listed with track artwork, name, and artist
- **Preview** — See the first few lines of each lyric
- **Last updated date** — When you last edited each lyric
- **Search** — Filter by track name, artist, or lyric content

### Managing Library Lyrics

From the library, you can:

- **Open lyrics** — Click the microphone icon to view and edit
- **Delete lyrics** — Click the trash icon and confirm deletion

## Desktop vs. Mobile

### Desktop

On desktop (screens wider than 1024px), the lyrics panel appears as a floating sidebar on the right side of the screen. It:

- Stays open while you browse
- Automatically adjusts position if the queue panel is open
- Provides the full-featured editor with all toolbar options

### Mobile and Tablet

On mobile and tablet devices, the lyrics panel opens as a full-screen overlay with:

- **White-themed seekbar** and playback controls for better visibility
- **Synced lyrics auto-scroll** with animated line highlighting
- Compact toolbar optimized for touch
- Larger tap targets for editing
- Same sync and section features in a mobile-friendly layout

## Tips for Songwriters

### Using Rhyme Highlighting

The editor automatically detects rhyming words and colors them. Lines that rhyme with each other share the same color dot, making it easy to see your rhyme scheme at a glance. Toggle rhyme highlighting with the **music note icon** in the toolbar.

### Working with BPM

If the beat has BPM information, you'll see a bar:beat counter (e.g., "8:3" means bar 8, beat 3). This helps you align your lyrics to specific musical moments.

### Section Organization

Use sections liberally to structure your song. A typical structure might be:
- `[Intro]`
- `[Verse 1]`
- `[Chorus]`
- `[Verse 2]`
- `[Chorus]`
- `[Bridge]`
- `[Outro]`

Sections are numbered automatically if you add multiples (Verse 1, Verse 2, etc.).
