## Reading Your Data

### Plays Chart

The plays timeline shows streaming activity over time:

- **Spikes** indicate viral moments or promotion success
- **Steady line** shows consistent organic engagement
- **Drops** may indicate seasonal patterns or content gaps

### Engagement Breakdown

Understand how listeners interact. We now track **partial listens** (over 10 seconds), giving you a complete picture of engagement even if users skip or leave early.

| Metric              | Good Sign                   | Warning Sign                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Completion Rate     | \> 60%                      | \< 30%                          |
| Save Rate           | \> 5%                       | \< 1%                           |
| Repeat Rate         | \> 10%                      | \< 2%                           |
| **Partial Listens** | High count means good hooks | Low count means immediate skips |

### Contribution Trends

Track your earning trajectory:

- Rising trend = Growing engagement value
- Flat trend = Stable but not growing
- Declining = May need content refresh

<Warning>
  The following analytics features are internal and not exposed to end users:
</Warning>

| Feature                     | Reason                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Real-time analytics**     | Reserved for platform monitoring   |

### Why Some Data Is Internal

| Reason          | Explanation                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Privacy**     | Listener-level data is protected                        |
| **Performance** | Real-time queries are expensive                         |
| **Fairness**    | Prevents gaming and manipulation                        |
| **Complexity**  | Some metrics are difficult to interpret without context |

### Setting Expectations

- **Public dashboards are the only analytics available** to producers
- Internal analytics exist for platform operations but aren't user-facing
- Export features may be added in future but aren't currently roadmapped
- If you need data we don't expose, contact support to discuss options
