## Export Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the right date range">
    Narrower date ranges produce smaller, more focused exports. For monthly reviews, select the specific month. For annual summaries, select the full year.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use CSV for analysis">
    CSV files work best when you want to create your own charts, pivot tables, or apply formulas in a spreadsheet application.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use PDF for sharing">
    PDF reports are ideal for sharing with collaborators, managers, or labels — they include formatted charts and don't require any special software to view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exports reflect the current view">
    The export includes data for the content and time period currently displayed in Backstage Insights. Make sure you're viewing the right track, album, or artist before exporting.
