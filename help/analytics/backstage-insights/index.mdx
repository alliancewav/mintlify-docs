Backstage Insights provides detailed analytics for individual tracks, albums, and artist profiles. Unlike the [Producer Dashboard](/help/producer-dashboard) which shows aggregate data across your entire catalog, Backstage Insights lets you drill down into the performance of specific content.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Track owners and collaborators. You can only view insights for content you own or are credited on.
</Info>
