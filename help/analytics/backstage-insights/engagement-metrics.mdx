## Overview

Engagement metrics provide deep insights into how listeners interact with your tracks. Unlike play counts (which just tell you _how many_ plays), engagement metrics tell you _how_ listeners engage—how long they listen, whether they complete your track, and where they drop off.

<Info>
  **Availability:** Engagement metrics are only available on **individual track insights** (`/backstage/tracks/{id}/insights`). They require per-play analysis and are not aggregated at the album or artist level.
</Info>

## Why Engagement Matters

| Metric Type    | What It Tells You                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Play Count** | How many times your track was started        |
| **Engagement** | How listeners actually experience your track |

High play counts with low engagement could indicate:

- Misleading titles or covers (people click but don't stay)
- Weak intros that don't hook listeners
- Structural issues in the track

High engagement means listeners find your content valuable and are more likely to:

- Return for future releases
- Share your music
- Purchase or license your tracks

### The Four Key Metrics

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Avg Listen Duration">
    **Icon:** Clock (blue)

    **What it measures:** The average time listeners spend on your track.

    **How to read it:**

    - Compare to your track length (shown in the badge)
    - If it's low relative to track length, listeners are leaving early
    - Example: "0:49" out of "3:06" means listeners hear only 26% on average

    **Progress bar:** Shows duration as % of track length
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Avg Completion Rate">
    **Icon:** Checkmark (color varies by level)

    **What it measures:** Percentage of your track that listeners complete on average — the <Tooltip tip="The average percentage of a track that listeners play through before stopping or skipping.">completion rate</Tooltip>.

    **How to read it:**

    - 100% = listeners finish the entire track
    - Lower percentages indicate where listeners stop
    - Badge shows retention level (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)

    **Progress bar:** Shows completion percentage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Total Listen Time">
    **Icon:** Bar chart (purple)

    **What it measures:** Cumulative listening time across all plays.

    **How to read it:**

    - Shows overall engagement volume
    - Useful for understanding total impact
    - Example: "4h 23m from 85 plays"

    **No progress bar** — This is a volume metric, not a percentage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Completed Listens">
    **Icon:** Trending up (green)

    **What it measures:** Number of plays that reached \>80% completion.

    **How to read it:**

    - The gold standard for engagement
    - Higher percentage = more engaged audience
    - Example: "12 completed (14.1% of all plays)"

    **Progress bar:** Shows completed listens as % of total plays
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quality Badge

The header displays an overall engagement rating that summarizes your track's performance:

### Badge Levels

| Badge                   | Color  | Criteria                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **High Engagement**     | Green  | ≥80% completion AND ≥80% of track listened |
| **Good Engagement**     | Blue   | ≥60% completion AND ≥60% of track listened |
| **Moderate Engagement** | Yellow | ≥40% completion OR ≥40% of track listened  |
| **Low Engagement**      | Red    | Below 40% on both metrics                  |

<Tip>
  The badge considers both completion rate AND average listen duration relative to track length. A 3-minute track with 1:30 average listen time and 50% completion shows "Moderate Engagement."
</Tip>

---

## Retention Levels

The Avg Completion Rate card shows a <Tooltip tip="A quick badge (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor) based on what percentage of your track listeners complete on average.">retention level</Tooltip> badge:

| Level         | Completion Rate | Badge Color | What It Means             |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **Excellent** | ≥80%            | Green       | Listeners love your track |
| **Good**      | 60-79%          | Blue        | Strong engagement         |
| **Fair**      | 40-59%          | Yellow      | Room for improvement      |
| **Poor**      | \< 40%          | Red         | Needs attention           |

This provides a quick assessment without needing to analyze percentages.

## Listen Duration Chart

An interactive bar chart showing how long listeners engage with your track over time.

### Chart Elements

| Element        | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**     | Clock icon, trend badge, average duration           |
| **Bars**       | Each bar = average listen duration for that day     |
| **Bar Height** | Taller bars = longer average listen time            |
| **Bar Colors** | Color-coded by completion rate                      |
| **Footer**     | Track length, best day, avg completion, total plays |

### Bar Colors (Completion Rate)

| Color            | Completion Rate | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Green**        | ≥70%            | Excellent — listeners hear most of the track |
| **Amber/Yellow** | 40-70%          | Good — engaged but drop off before end       |
| **Red**          | \< 40%          | Needs attention — listeners skip early       |

### Trend Calculation

The trend percentage indicates whether engagement is improving:

1. Your selected date range is split in half
2. Average listen duration from the **first half** vs **second half**
3. The percentage change is shown as the trend

| Badge            | Example | Meaning                        |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Green (+15%)** | \+15%   | Engagement improved recently   |
| **Red (-25%)**   | -25%    | Engagement declined recently   |
| **Orange (0%)**  | 0%      | Stable — no significant change |

<Note>
  A negative trend doesn't necessarily mean your track is bad. It could indicate a shift in audience (e.g., new listeners discovering via short-form content).
</Note>

### Interactive Tooltips

**Desktop:** Hover over any bar to see:

- Average Duration (e.g., "1:23")
- Completion Rate (e.g., "65%")
- Play Count (e.g., "12 plays")
- Date

**Mobile:** Tap any bar to show tooltip. Tap again or outside to dismiss.

## Completion Breakdown Chart

A grid showing how much of your track listeners complete, broken into five categories.

### Categories

| Category      | Icon       | Range  | Weight  | Description       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------- |
| **Completed** | ✓ (green)  | \>80%  | 100 pts | Heard almost all  |
| **Mostly**    | ◉ (blue)   | 60-80% | 70 pts  | Strong engagement |
| **Half**      | ○ (amber)  | 40-60% | 50 pts  | About half        |
| **Partial**   | ⊘ (orange) | 20-40% | 30 pts  | Lost interest     |
| **Skipped**   | ⏩ (red)    | \< 20% | 10 pts  | Skipped early     |

### Quality Score Formula

The <Tooltip tip="A weighted 0–100 score summarizing listener retention, calculated from how many listeners completed, mostly heard, or skipped the track.">Quality Score</Tooltip> is a weighted average (0-100) summarizing retention:

```
Quality Score = (Completed×100 + Mostly×70 + Half×50 + Partial×30 + Skipped×10) / Total Plays
```

**Example calculation:** 20 plays: 10 completed, 5 mostly, 3 half, 1 partial, 1 skipped

```
Score = (10×100 + 5×70 + 3×50 + 1×30 + 1×10) / 20
      = (1000 + 350 + 150 + 30 + 10) / 20
      = 1540 / 20
      = 77 (Good)
```

### Quality Score Ratings

| Score      | Rating     | Meaning                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **80-100** | Excellent  | Listeners love your track  |
| **60-79**  | Good       | Solid with room to improve |
| **40-59**  | Fair       | Many listeners drop off    |
| **20-39**  | Needs Work | Most leave early           |
| **0-19**   | Poor       | Almost everyone skips      |

## Interpreting Engagement Data

### Common Patterns

| Pattern               | Likely Cause         | Action                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **High skips**        | Weak intro           | Strengthen first 15-30 seconds |
| **Drops at 50%**      | Energy dip in middle | Review track structure         |
| **Drops near end**    | Weak outro           | Add stronger closing           |
| **Consistently high** | Great content        | Keep your current approach     |
| **Declining trend**   | Audience fatigue     | Consider new releases          |

### What Affects Engagement

| Factor                 | Impact                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Track intro**        | First 15-30 seconds are critical      |
| **Energy flow**        | Consistent engagement keeps listeners |
| **Track length**       | Longer tracks face more drop-off      |
| **Genre expectations** | Match what listeners expect           |
| **Audio quality**      | Poor quality drives listeners away    |

## Tips for Improving Engagement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hook them early">
    Start with your strongest element. Don't save the best for later—many won't hear it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain energy">
    Avoid long quiet sections or energy dips that give listeners an exit point.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize length">
    Match your track length to genre expectations. Shorter is often better for engagement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Strong outro">
    Give listeners a reason to finish. A weak ending leads to early exits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A/B test intros">
    If engagement is low, try releasing alternate versions with different intros.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Availability

<Warning>
  Engagement tracking is being rolled out progressively. Tracks with plays before the feature launch may show "Engagement tracking coming soon" with a note about the pre-tracking play count.
