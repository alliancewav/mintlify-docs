## Overview

Album insights (`/backstage/albums/{id}/insights`) show aggregate analytics for all tracks in an album. Unlike track insights which focus on a single piece of content, album insights combine data from every track in the collection.

<Info>
  **Access:** Right-click any album → Insights, or navigate directly to `/backstage/albums/{albumId}/insights`
