## Data & Updates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often is my data updated?">
    | Data Type | Update Frequency |
    |-----------|------------------|
    | Play counts | Near real-time |
    | Download events | Near real-time |
    | XP & Level | Immediately on each action |
    | Leaderboard rankings | Every 30 minutes (cached) |
    | Progress data | Every 5 minutes (cached) |
    | Financial balances | Synced with Stripe |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why do my play counts seem low?">
    Possible reasons:
    - Plays are tracked via analytics events and require the track to actually be played
    - There may be a slight delay in data processing during high-traffic periods
    - Check the time period filter selected in the Activity page
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why don't I see any data in my dashboard?">
    You need:
    - An artist profile linked to your account
    - At least one track uploaded
    - Upload permissions enabled
    
    If you just created your profile or uploaded tracks, wait a few minutes for data to sync.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## XP & Leveling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I earn XP?">
    XP is earned through various actions:
    
    | Action | XP Earned |
    |--------|-----------|
    | Upload a track | +100 XP |
    | Track plays | +1 XP per play |
    | Complete metadata | +50 XP per track |
    | Collaborate on tracks | +25 XP per collaboration |
    | Unlock achievements | Variable (based on achievement rarity) |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why isn't my XP increasing?">
    Check that:
    - You have an artist profile with a completed user profile
    - Your tracks are actually being played (not just loaded)
    - XP deduplication prevents double-awarding for the same action
    
    Each play, upload, or action is only awarded XP once.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is my level calculated?">
    Your level is based on total XP using this formula:
    
    ```
    XP Required = 100 × ((Level - 1) ^ 1.5)
    ```
    
    The maximum level is 100 (Legendary Producer).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do collaborators earn XP from my tracks?">
    Yes! When a track with collaborators gets plays:
    - The track owner earns XP
    - All credited collaborators with completed user profiles also earn XP
    
    Collaborators without completed profiles won't receive XP until they complete their profile setup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Leaderboards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is the Overall leaderboard calculated?">
    The Overall leaderboard uses a weighted composite score:
    
    | Category | Weight |
    |----------|--------|
    | Points (XP) | 25% |
    | Plays | 20% |
    | Uploads | 15% |
    | Quality | 15% |
    | Collaboration | 15% |
    | Earnings | 10% |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my ranking drop even though my plays increased?">
    Rankings are relative to other producers. If other producers grew faster, your rank may drop even with personal growth. 
    
    Focus on improving your absolute metrics rather than just ranking position.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often do leaderboards update?">
    Leaderboard data is cached for 30 minutes to ensure consistent performance. Your rank will update at most every 30 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does the Quality leaderboard measure?">
    The Quality leaderboard ranks producers by metadata completion percentage:
    - Complete title, BPM, key, scale, genre, description, and cover art
    - Higher percentage = higher ranking
    - Encourages well-organized catalogs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
