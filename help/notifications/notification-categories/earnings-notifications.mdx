## Understanding License Notifications

License Granted notifications include:
- **Non-exclusive licenses** — When subscribers download your beat
- **Exclusive licenses** — When someone purchases exclusive rights

Both trigger notifications so you can track all licensing activity.

---

## Play Milestones

You'll receive notifications when your beats hit these milestones:
- 100 plays
- 1,000 plays (1K)
- 10,000 plays (10K)
- And higher milestones

These help you celebrate your growth and identify your most popular beats.

## Tips

- **Never disable email for payouts** — You need to know when payments are processed or need action
- **Track your top performers** — Play milestones help identify what's resonating with listeners
- **Keep analytics reports enabled** — Regular summaries help you understand your overall performance
