2. A dropdown appears showing your recent notifications
3. Click any notification to go directly to the related content

### Full Page View

1. Navigate to `/notifications` directly
2. You'll see all your notifications in a larger, scrollable list

<Note>
  The bell icon shows a red badge with a number when you have unread notifications.

## Understanding Your Notifications

Each notification shows:

- **Icon/Image** — Visual indicator of the notification type or the user involved
- **Message** — Description of what happened (e.g., "Alex started following you")
- **Time** — When it happened, shown as relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- **Unread indicator** — Unread notifications appear with a highlighted background

## Managing Notifications

### Mark as Read

Notifications are automatically marked as read when you click on them. You can also:

- **Mark All as Read** — Click the **Mark all** button (or **Mark all as read** on the full page) to clear all unread notifications at once

### Notification Actions

Clicking a notification takes you to the relevant page:

| Notification | Takes You To |
|--------------|--------------|
| New Follower | The follower's profile |
| Track Like | Your track page |
| Comment | The comment on your track |
| Direct Message | Your conversation |
| Beat Submission | Your beat request |
| License Granted | License details |
| Achievement Unlocked | Your progress page |

## Empty Notifications

If you don't have any notifications yet, you'll see a friendly message: **"Hang tight!"** with an explanation that notifications will start appearing soon.

Notifications will appear as:
- Producers you follow upload new beats
- People interact with your content
- You receive messages
- And more!

---

## Notification Settings Shortcut

From the Notification Center dropdown, you can quickly access your notification preferences:

1. Click the **settings icon** (gear) in the dropdown header
2. This opens your Notification Settings page at `/notifications/settings`
3. Adjust which notifications you receive and how

## Tips for Managing Notifications

- **Check regularly** — In-app notifications don't send emails unless you've enabled both, so check the bell icon often
- **Prioritize what matters** — Turn off notifications you don't need to reduce noise
- **Enable browser notifications** — Get real-time alerts without checking manually
- **Don't ignore emails** — Important notifications like license grants and payouts are often sent via email
