In-app notifications appear in your notification center — the bell icon in the top navigation bar. They collect all your updates in one place so you can review them at your convenience.

## How In-App Notifications Work

When you have in-app enabled for a notification type:

1. An event happens (new follower, track like, etc.)
2. The notification appears in your notification center
3. The bell icon shows a badge with your unread count
4. Click the notification to go to the relevant content

---

## Accessing Your Notifications

### Quick View

1. Click the **bell icon** in the navigation bar
2. A dropdown shows your recent notifications
3. Click any notification to view details

### Full Page View

1. Navigate to `/notifications`
2. View all your notifications in a larger list
3. Use **Mark all as read** to clear unread badges

---

## Managing In-App Preferences

### From the Settings Page

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. For each notification type, toggle **In-App** on or off
3. Click **Save Preferences**

### Quick Controls

Use the **In-App** toggle in the Quick Controls section to:
- Enable in-app notifications for all types
- Disable in-app notifications for all types

---

## Unread Badge

The bell icon shows a red badge with a number when you have unread notifications.

### How the Count Works

- **Increases** when new notifications arrive
- **Decreases** when you click on notifications
- **Clears** when you use "Mark all as read"

### Mark All as Read

To clear all unread notifications at once:
1. Open the notification dropdown
2. Click **Mark all** (or **Mark all as read** on the full page)
3. All notifications are marked as read

## Notification Lifespan

In-app notifications are kept for a period of time so you can review them later. Old notifications are eventually removed automatically.

Unlike emails, in-app notifications don't require immediate attention — they wait for you in your notification center.

---

## When to Use In-App

In-app notifications are great for:
- **Medium-priority updates** — Track likes, comments, reposts
- **Activity tracking** — See all your engagement in one place
- **Low-noise option** — Updates without email or browser interruptions

---

## Best Practices

- **Use as your default** — In-app notifications don't interrupt your workflow
- **Check regularly** — If you disable email for some notifications, check the bell icon often
- **Combine with email for important items** — Enable both for license grants, payouts, etc.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Notification count seems wrong">
    Try refreshing the page. The count updates in real-time but may occasionally need a refresh.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't see any notifications">
    Check that In-App is enabled for notification types in `/notifications/settings`. If you just joined, notifications will start appearing as you get activity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Notifications aren't appearing for specific events">
    Make sure In-App is toggled on for that specific notification type in your settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
