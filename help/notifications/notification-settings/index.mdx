## Understanding the Settings Page

### Your Role Badge

At the top of the page, you'll see your current role:
- **Member** — Regular user without producer access
- **Producer** — User with an approved producer profile
- **Verified Producer** — Producer with verified status

Your role determines which notification categories you can access.

### Quick Controls

At the top of the settings, you'll find bulk controls:

- **Enable All** — Turn on all notification channels for all categories
- **Disable All** — Turn off all notification channels
- **Per-channel toggles** — Enable or disable all notifications for a specific channel (Email, Browser, or In-App)

### Notification Categories

Each category contains one or more notification types. Categories include:
- Following
- Social
- Messages
- Beat Requests
- Promotions
- Producer Activity (producers only)
- Earnings & Licensing (producers only)
- Achievements (producers only)
- Producer Dashboard (verified producers only)

### Channel Toggles

For each notification type, you can toggle three channels:

| Channel | Icon | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Email** | Mail icon | Sends notifications to your email inbox |
| **Browser** | Bell icon | Shows real-time pop-ups in your browser |
| **In-App** | Inbox icon | Appears in your notification center (bell icon) |

## Locked Notifications

Some notifications are only available to certain user types:

- **Producer-only notifications** — Shown as locked for regular members
- **Verified producer notifications** — Shown as a locked preview for regular producers

A lock icon indicates notifications you can't currently access. Upgrade your account or apply for verification to unlock them.

## Browser Permission

1. Your browser will ask for permission to show notifications
2. Click **Allow** to enable real-time alerts
3. If blocked, you'll see a warning on the settings page

<Warning>
  If you previously blocked browser notifications, you'll need to manually enable them in your browser settings. The settings page will show a warning if browser notifications are blocked.
