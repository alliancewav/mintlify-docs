Email notifications keep you informed about important activity on BeatPass, even when you're not on the platform. You can customize which notifications you receive via email and easily unsubscribe from specific types.

## How Email Notifications Work

When you have email enabled for a notification type:

1. An event happens (someone follows you, likes your beat, etc.)
2. BeatPass sends an email to your registered email address
3. The email includes details about what happened and a link to take action

---

## Managing Email Preferences

### From the Settings Page

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. For each notification type, toggle the **Email** switch on or off
3. Click **Save Preferences**

### Quick Controls

Use the **Email** toggle in the Quick Controls section to:
- Enable email for all notifications at once
- Disable email for all notifications at once

---

## Unsubscribing from Emails

### From an Email

Every notification email includes unsubscribe options at the bottom:

- **Unsubscribe from this type** — Stop receiving this specific notification via email
- **Unsubscribe from all** — Stop receiving all email notifications
- **Manage preferences** — Opens your notification settings page

<Tip>
  These one-click unsubscribe links work without requiring you to log in.
</Tip>

### From the Settings Page

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. Turn off the Email toggle for notifications you don't want
3. Click **Save Preferences**

---

## Re-subscribing to Emails

If you previously unsubscribed but want to receive emails again:

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. Turn on the Email toggle for the notification types you want
3. Click **Save Preferences**

If you used an unsubscribe link, you may also see a **Resubscribe** option on the confirmation page.

## Email Delivery

### Where Emails Go

Emails are sent to the email address associated with your BeatPass account. Make sure your email is up to date in your account settings.

### Checking Spam

If you're not receiving emails:
1. Check your spam or junk folder
2. Add notifications from BeatPass to your safe senders list
3. Verify your email address is correct in your account settings

---

## System Emails

Some emails cannot be turned off:
- Password reset requests
- Security alerts
- Account changes (email or password updates)
- Critical platform announcements

These are sent to keep your account secure.

## Best Practices

- **Enable for important notifications** — License grants, payouts, and security alerts
- **Consider disabling for high-volume notifications** — Track likes, comments (use In-App instead)
- **Check your spam folder** — If emails aren't arriving, they may be filtered
