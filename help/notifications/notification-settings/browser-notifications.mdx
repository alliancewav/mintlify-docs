Browser notifications deliver real-time alerts directly to your browser, even when you're not actively looking at BeatPass. They're perfect for instant updates about messages, likes, and other important activity.

## How Browser Notifications Work

When you enable browser notifications:

1. An event happens (new message, new follower, etc.)
2. Your browser displays a pop-up notification
3. Click the notification to go directly to the relevant content

<Note>
  Browser notifications only work when you have BeatPass open in a browser tab (it doesn't need to be the active tab).
</Note>

## Enabling Browser Notifications

### First-Time Setup

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. Toggle on **Browser** for any notification type
3. Your browser will ask for permission
4. Click **Allow** in the browser prompt

### Browser Permission Prompt

When asked to allow notifications:
- **Allow** — Enables real-time notifications
- **Block** — Prevents notifications (can be changed later in browser settings)
- **Dismiss/Ignore** — Browser will ask again later

## If Notifications Are Blocked

If you previously blocked notifications, you'll see a warning on the settings page:

> "Browser notifications are blocked. Enable them in your browser settings."

### How to Unblock

The process varies by browser:

**Chrome:**
1. Click the lock icon in the address bar
2. Find "Notifications" setting
3. Change from "Block" to "Allow"

**Firefox:**
1. Click the shield or lock icon in the address bar
2. Click on the permissions section
3. Allow notifications

**Safari:**
1. Go to Safari → Preferences → Websites → Notifications
2. Find BeatPass and set to "Allow"

**Edge:**
1. Click the lock icon in the address bar
2. Find "Notifications" setting
3. Change to "Allow"

## Managing Browser Notifications

### From the Settings Page

1. Go to `/notifications/settings`
2. For each notification type, toggle **Browser** on or off
3. Click **Save Preferences**

### Quick Controls

Use the **Browser** toggle in the Quick Controls section to:
- Enable browser notifications for all types
- Disable browser notifications for all types

---

## When You'll See Notifications

Browser notifications appear:
- When a relevant event occurs
- When BeatPass is open in any browser tab
- When you have the Browser channel enabled for that notification type

You won't see browser notifications:
- If you've closed all BeatPass browser tabs
- If you've blocked browser notifications
- If the Browser channel is disabled for that type

---

## Notification Appearance

Browser notifications typically show:
- **Title** — What happened (e.g., "New Message")
- **Body** — Who did what (e.g., "Alex sent you a message")
- **Icon** — BeatPass logo or user avatar

Click the notification to open BeatPass and go directly to the relevant content.

---

## Best Practices

- **Enable for high-priority items** — Messages, license grants, payouts
- **Consider disabling for high-volume notifications** — Track likes (can be overwhelming)
- **Keep BeatPass open** — Even in a background tab for notifications to work
