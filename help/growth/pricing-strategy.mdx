## Pricing Strategies

### Tiered Licensing

Create multiple tiers to serve different buyer needs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic ($29)">
    **MP3 only, 5K streams** — For testing ideas, demos, or low-budget projects. Gets customers in the door.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standard ($49)">
    **MP3 + WAV, 50K streams** — Most popular tier. Perfect for singles, EPs, and serious hobbyists.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Premium ($99)">
    **All files, 100K streams** — For albums and artists with growing audiences. Include trackouts if possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unlimited ($199)">
    **Unlimited streams** — For commercial artists who don't want to worry about caps. Strong value proposition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exclusive ($499+)">
    **Full rights, all stems** — Buyer owns the beat exclusively. You set the premium based on track quality and your reputation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Most sales come from Standard and Premium tiers. Make these your strongest offerings.
</Tip>

### Competitive Analysis

Before setting prices:

1. **Research Similar Producers**: Find producers at your level in your genre
2. **Check Their Pricing**: Note their tier structure and prices
3. **Evaluate Quality**: Compare your production quality honestly
4. **Position Accordingly**: Price slightly below, at, or above based on quality

## Contribution vs. Direct Sales

### Revenue Streams

On BeatPass, you earn from two sources:

1. **Direct License Sales**: One-time payments for licensing
2. **Contribution Pool**: Ongoing earnings from streaming engagement

### Pricing Impact

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Higher License Prices" icon="arrow-up">
    **Fewer sales, more per sale.** Works best for established producers with proven quality. Requires strong marketing and brand recognition.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lower/No License Prices" icon="arrow-down">
    **More streams, contribution-based income.** Good for building catalog exposure and contribution earnings. Lower barrier attracts more listeners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balanced Approach" icon="scale-balanced">
    **Mix of direct sales and streaming revenue.** Most recommended. License your best work, let catalog tracks drive contribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Consider your goals:**

- **Quick revenue**: Focus on competitive license pricing
- **Long-term building**: Encourage streaming, build contribution value
- **Maximum total earnings**: Balance both revenue streams

## Setting Exclusive Prices

### Exclusive Pricing Factors

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Track-Specific Factors" icon="music">
    - **Popularity**: High plays = higher price
    - **Uniqueness**: One-of-a-kind sounds command premium
    - **Existing Sales**: Non-exclusive sales prove demand
    - **Production Complexity**: Complex arrangements = higher value
  </Card>
  <Card title="Producer Factors" icon="user">
    - **Reputation**: Established = higher prices
    - **Placements**: Famous clients justify premium
    - **Consistency**: Track record of quality
    - **Exclusivity History**: Past exclusive sales as benchmarks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Exclusive Pricing Formula

A starting point for exclusive pricing:

```
Base Exclusive Price = (Average Non-Exclusive Price × 10) + Premium Factor
```

Example: If your non-exclusive averages \$50:

- Base: $50 × 10 = $500
- Add premium for popular beats: +\$200-500
- Final range: \$500-1000
