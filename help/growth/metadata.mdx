## Overview

Metadata is the information attached to your tracks: title, BPM, key, genre, tags, and description. Optimized metadata helps artists find your beats and improves your contribution value.

<Info>
  **Audience:** Producers

## Why Metadata Matters

### Discovery Impact

| Metadata Quality | Search Visibility | Contribution Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Complete | High | Positive boost |
| Partial | Medium | Neutral |
| Missing/Inaccurate | Low | Negative impact |

### Artist Experience

Artists filter by:
- BPM (to match vocal recordings)
- Key/Scale (for vocal melody planning)
- Genre (to find their style)
- Tags (for mood and vibe)

Inaccurate metadata frustrates artists and loses sales.

## Essential Metadata

### BPM (Beats Per Minute)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why Accuracy Matters">
    Artists often record vocals at specific tempos. A beat labeled 140 BPM that's actually 150 BPM creates problems during production.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to Verify">
    - Check your DAW's tempo setting
    - Use a BPM analyzer tool
    - Tap along manually to verify
    - Round to nearest whole number
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Common Ranges by Genre">
    | Genre | Typical BPM |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Trap | 130-170 |
    | Hip Hop | 80-100 |
    | Drill | 140-150 |
    | R&B | 60-90 |
    | Lo-Fi | 70-90 |
    | Pop | 100-130 |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Key and Scale

The musical key determines which notes are used:

| Key | Scale | Mood Tendency |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| C | Major | Bright, happy |
| A | Minor | Emotional, melancholic |
| D | Minor | Serious, dramatic |
| G | Major | Uplifting, warm |
| E | Minor | Dark, intense |
| F | Major | Peaceful, calm |

<Tip>
  If you're unsure of the key, use a key detection tool like Mixed In Key or Keyfinder. Many DAWs also have built-in detection.
</Tip>

### Genre Classification

Select the most accurate primary genre:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Primary Genre">
    Choose the genre that best describes the overall style. This is your main classification.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Secondary Genre (if available)">
    Add a secondary genre for hybrid styles. Example: Primary "Trap", Secondary "R&B" for trap soul beats.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid Overgeneralization">
    "Hip Hop" is very broad. "Boom Bap" or "Trap" is more specific and discoverable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tags Strategy

### Tag Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use 5-10 Tags">
    Too few limits discovery; too many dilutes relevance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    "dark melodic" is better than just "dark" or "melodic" alone.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Include Mood Tags">
    Aggressive, chill, emotional, uplifting, dark, energetic, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Style Descriptors">
    Bouncy, hard, melodic, atmospheric, minimal, complex, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Use Cases">
    Freestyle, hook, verse, commercial, radio, club, etc.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tag Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Mood** | dark, uplifting, aggressive, chill, emotional, dreamy |
| **Style** | melodic, hard, bouncy, atmospheric, minimal, experimental |
| **Instruments** | piano, guitar, 808, synth, strings, flute |
| **Use Case** | freestyle, hook, verse, commercial, radio |
| **Influence** | (use sparingly) drake type, metro style |

### Tags to Avoid

<Warning>
  Don't use misleading tags just for visibility.
</Warning>

- Irrelevant popular tags
- Competitor names
- Clickbait terms
- Offensive language
- Excessive variations of the same word

## Title Optimization

### Title Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Short and memorable (2-4 words) | Generic names ("Beat 1", "Untitled") |
| Descriptive keywords | Special characters or emojis |
| Easy to search | Very long titles |
| Unique within your catalog | Copy other producers' titles |

### Title Examples

| Good | Why |
|------|-----|
| "Midnight Chase" | Evocative, memorable |
| "Summer Waves" | Clear mood, searchable |
| "Neon Dreams" | Visual, distinctive |
| "Cold Streets" | Genre-appropriate, evocative |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "Beat 147" | Not searchable or memorable |
| "Fire Type Beat" | Generic, undifferentiated |
| "Drake x Metro Boomin" | Misleading if not a collab |

## Description Writing

### What to Include

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vibe Description">
    2-3 sentences describing the mood and feel. Help artists visualize using the beat.
    
    Example: "Dark, atmospheric trap beat with haunting melodies and heavy 808s. Perfect for introspective verses or emotional hooks."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Production Notes">
    Mention notable elements: unique instruments, production techniques, inspiration.
    
    Example: "Features live guitar samples, layered synths, and punchy drums inspired by late-night city vibes."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Case Suggestions">
    Help artists imagine how to use it.
    
    Example: "Great for storytelling tracks, music videos, or streaming singles."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
