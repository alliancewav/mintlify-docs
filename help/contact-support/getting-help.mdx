## Tips for Faster Resolution

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about your issue">
    Instead of "it doesn't work," describe exactly what's happening. For example: "When I click the play button on a track, nothing happens and I see a loading spinner that never stops."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include screenshots">
    A picture is worth a thousand words. Screenshots help the team understand exactly what you're seeing and identify issues faster.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide your account email">
    Even if you're not logged in, providing your account email helps the team look up your account and understand your situation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Try basic troubleshooting first">
    Sometimes clearing your browser cache, trying a different browser, or logging out and back in resolves common issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
