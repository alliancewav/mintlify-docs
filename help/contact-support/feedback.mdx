## Writing Effective Feedback

Good feedback helps us understand and prioritize improvements.

### Be Specific

Instead of:
> "The search could be better"

Try:
> "It would be helpful if the beat search could filter by key signature and tempo range, so I can find beats that match my vocal recordings."

### Explain the Problem

Help the team understand:
- What are you trying to accomplish?
- What's preventing you from doing it easily?
- How does this affect your workflow?

### Include Examples

If possible, provide:
- Screenshots showing what you mean
- Specific scenarios where this would be useful
- How other platforms handle similar features (if relevant)

### Prioritization

When deciding what to build next, the team considers:

- **User impact** — How many users would benefit?
- **Problem severity** — How significant is the issue?
- **Alignment with vision** — Does it fit the product direction?
- **Technical feasibility** — Is it achievable with available resources?
