|--------|---------|--------|
| **Producer Dashboard** | Career-level analytics: XP, leaderboards, achievements, earnings, catalog management | `/producer-dashboard` |
| **Backstage Insights** | Content-level analytics: per-track/album/artist plays, listeners, geography, engagement | `/backstage/{type}/{id}/insights` |
