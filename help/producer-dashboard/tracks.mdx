## Growth Meter

A unique visual gauge that shows your catalog's growth trajectory at a glance.

### How It Works

The Growth Meter is a semi-circular gauge with a needle indicator:

| Zone | Color | Growth Rate | Label |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Left** | Red | Below -5% | Declining |
| **Center-Left** | Amber/Yellow | -5% to 0% | Stable |
| **Center-Right** | Light Green | 0% to +5% | Growing |
| **Right** | Green | Above +5% | Strong |

### Meter Components

- **Arc Background** — Gray track showing the full range
- **Gradient Arc** — Color gradient from red (left) to green (right)
- **Needle** — Animated pointer showing your current position
- **Percentage Value** — Large numeric display (e.g., "+7.5%")
- **Status Label** — Word describing your growth zone

<Tip>
  The needle animates smoothly when your growth rate changes, providing satisfying visual feedback.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="No Growth Rate Displayed">
  If the Growth Meter shows "—" or "Calculating":
  - You may not have enough historical data yet
  - Wait 24-48 hours after uploading your first tracks
  - Growth rate requires at least one week of data
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Recommendations Empty">
  If no collaboration recommendations appear:
  - Upload more tracks with complete genre metadata
  - Ensure your tracks have genres assigned
  - System needs at least 3-5 tracks to analyze patterns
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collaborators Not Showing">
  If your collaborations aren't appearing:
  - Verify collaborator credits are saved on the track
  - Check that collaborators have artist profiles on BeatPass
  - Data may take a few minutes to update after track edits
</Accordion>
