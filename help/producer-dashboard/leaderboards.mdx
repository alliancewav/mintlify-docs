## Ranking Categories

BeatPass measures producer performance across six distinct categories. Select any category to see the top performers and find your position.

### Overall

A composite score that combines all ranking factors:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Points (XP) | 25% |
| Plays | 20% |
| Quality | 15% |
| Collaboration | 15% |
| Uploads | 15% |
| Earnings | 10% |

The Overall ranking gives a balanced view of your total producer presence on the platform.

### Quality

Measures how complete your track metadata is across your catalog.

**What counts toward Quality:**
- BPM set correctly
- Key and scale defined
- Tags added
- Description written

Producers with higher metadata completion percentages rank higher. This rewards those who take time to properly label and describe their beats.

### Uploads

Ranks producers by total number of published tracks.

**What counts:**
- Only approved, public tracks
- Private or pending tracks don't count

Regular uploaders may receive visibility boosts as they climb this ranking.

### Plays

Ranks producers by total track play counts.

**Fair play measures:**
- Authentic listening sessions only
- Bot or artificial plays are filtered out
- Minimum listen duration required to count

This ranking rewards producers whose beats resonate with listeners.

### Earnings

Ranks producers by their platform contribution share based on track performance.

### Collaboration

Ranks producers by their collaborative activity.

**What counts:**
- Number of collaborative tracks
- Unique collaborators you've worked with

Producers who actively collaborate with others rise in this category.
