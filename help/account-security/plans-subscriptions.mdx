## Beat Request Tokens

### How Tokens Work

Beat request tokens control how many custom beat requests you can submit each calendar month. Your monthly token allocation depends on your current plan; see the pricing page or your account settings for exact limits.

### Token Reset

- Tokens reset on the **reset date** shown in your account (typically once per calendar month, UTC)
- Unused tokens do **not** carry over
- You can check your remaining tokens in **Beat Requests \> My Requests**

### Token Status

You can view your token status when creating a beat request:

```
You have 3 tokens remaining this month.
You've used 7 of 10 tokens.
Reset date: December 1, 2025
```

_Example output only — your actual numbers depend on your plan and current usage._

## Producer Access (Backstage)

### What Producers Get

Producer status is separate from subscription tier. Approved producers gain:

| Feature                   | Description                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Upload tracks**         | Publish beats to the platform       |
| **Backstage dashboard**   | Access producer analytics           |
| **Licensing**             | Sell licenses for your beats        |
| **Contribution earnings** | Share in subscription revenue       |
| **Payout eligibility**    | Receive earnings via Stripe Connect |

### Becoming a Producer

1. Apply for backstage access from your profile
2. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 business days)
3. Complete onboarding steps
4. Start uploading

<Note>
  Producer access is free. You don't need a paid subscription to be a producer.
</Note>

## Subscription Pricing

### Current Plans

| Plan    | Price              | Billing                     |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Monthly | Check pricing page | Billed monthly              |
| Annual  | Check pricing page | Billed annually (save ~17%) |

View current pricing at **Settings \> Subscription** or the pricing page.

### Platform Fee Structure

For license purchases, BeatPass applies a 15% platform fee **on top** of the producer's price:

| Component             | Example                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Producer price        | \$100.00                                  |
| Platform fee (15%)    | \$15.00                                   |
| **Buyer pays**        | **\$115.00**                              |
| **Producer receives** | **\$100.00 minus Stripe processing fees** |

<Tip>
  The platform fee is added to the listed price and kept by BeatPass. Standard Stripe processing fees are deducted from your portion before funds arrive in your Stripe Connect balance.
</Tip>

## Subscription Revenue Distribution

### How Subscription Revenue Works

Subscription payments are split between a producer pool and BeatPass platform revenue. BeatPass charges a platform fee (for example, 15%) on top of the base subscription price, paid by the subscriber.

| Component                   | How It Works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base subscription price** | Portion of each paid subscription invoice allocated to the producer pool for contribution-based splits                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Platform fee (15%)**      | Added on top of the subscription price (paid by subscriber) and kept by BeatPass                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Stripe fees**             | Stripe processing fees on subscription charges are effectively covered from BeatPass’s side (for example, out of the platform fee). The producer pool is calculated on the full base subscription amount; additional payout-related Stripe fees may apply when funds move from Stripe to your bank. |

**Example:**

| Component                  | Amount      |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Base subscription          | \$29.00     |
| Platform fee (15%)         | \$4.35      |
| **Subscriber pays**        | **\$33.35** |
| **Producer pool receives** | **\$29.00** |

Producers receive their share of the pool based on the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula)calculated from plays, time decay, and collaboration splits.

<Tip>
  Conceptually, both subscriptions and exclusive purchases follow a similar pattern: customers pay your base price plus a platform fee. BeatPass keeps the platform fee, and your share of the base price (minus Stripe fees) is paid out via Stripe Connect or contribution splits.
</Tip>

## Managing Your Subscription

### Subscribe

1. Go to **Settings \> Subscription**
2. Choose your plan (Classic, Plus, or Pro)
3. Select billing frequency (monthly or annual)
4. Complete payment via Stripe
5. Benefits activate immediately

### Upgrade Your Plan

Upgrading (e.g., Classic → Plus) works as follows:

| Aspect               | Default Behavior                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Timing**           | Scheduled for next renewal date (default)                                |
| **Immediate Option** | If you select "Apply Now" and have a payment method, charges immediately |
| **Proration**        | Only charged if applying immediately; prorated for remaining days        |
| **Payment Required** | Only required for immediate upgrades                                     |

<Note>
  **Scheduled upgrades are the default.** The API defaults `applyImmediately` to `false`. To upgrade immediately with proration, you must explicitly choose the "Apply Now" option and have a valid payment method.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If you request an immediate upgrade but payment fails, the upgrade is rejected and you remain on your current plan.
</Warning>

### Downgrade Your Plan

Downgrading (e.g., Pro → Classic) works as follows:

| Aspect                    | How It Works                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing**                | Always scheduled for next renewal date              |
| **Immediate Effect**      | None—you keep current plan benefits until renewal   |
| **Proration**             | No charge or refund; change applies at renewal      |
| **Cancel Pending Change** | You can cancel a scheduled downgrade before renewal |

<Warning>
  Downgrades are **always** scheduled for the next billing cycle. Even if you request immediate application, the code forces `applyImmediately = false` for downgrades to avoid refund complications.
</Warning>

### Cancel Subscription

1. Go to **Settings \> Subscription**
2. Click **Manage Subscription**
3. Select **Cancel**
4. Access continues until the end of your current billing period (grace period)

### Resume a Cancelled Subscription

If you cancelled but are still within your billing period (grace period):

1. Go to **Settings \> Subscription**
2. Click **Resume Subscription**
3. Your subscription continues with no interruption

<Note>
  You can only resume during the grace period. Once the billing period ends, you must subscribe again.
</Note>

- Some regions support additional methods

### Invoices

- Invoices are emailed after each payment

### Failed Payments

If your subscription payment fails:

| Step               | What Happens                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate**      | `PaymentFailed` notification sent to you                                  |
| **Retry Behavior** | Handled by Stripe (not BeatPass)—typically one automatic retry            |
| **Access**         | No local access gating implemented; depends on Stripe subscription status |
| **Final Failure**  | Stripe may cancel subscription; you'll need to resubscribe                |

**To restore access after payment failure:**

1. Go to **Settings \> Subscription**
2. Click **Update Payment Method**
3. Enter new card details
4. Payment will be retried by Stripe

<Note>
  BeatPass does not implement custom retry logic or backoff schedules. Payment retries are handled entirely by Stripe's default behavior. The notification email states: "We will automatically attempt to charge your card again in 24 hours. If we are unable to do so, your subscription will be cancelled."
</Note>

### Grace Period

After cancellation, you enter a **grace period**:

- **Duration**: Until the end of your current billing period
- **Access**: Full subscriber benefits continue
- **Downloads**: You can still download beats during grace period
- **Licenses**: Any beats downloaded remain licensed forever

Once the grace period ends:

- Streaming reverts to preview-only (free tier)
- You cannot download new beats
- Previously downloaded beats and licenses are unaffected
