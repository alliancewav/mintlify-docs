## Commercial Licensing

### How Downloads Work

When you download a beat with a paid subscription:

1. You receive the high-quality audio file (WAV/MP3)
2. A non-exclusive commercial license is automatically granted
3. A license certificate is generated with BeatPassID verification
4. Your rights are permanent—even if you cancel your subscription

### License Terms

Each download includes a **non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license** allowing you to:

- Release on all streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Monetize on YouTube and social media
- Use in live performances
- Create derivative works (your songs)

For exclusive ownership or stem access, purchase an exclusive license separately. See [License Terms Explained](/help/legal/license-terms) for full details.

## Beat Request Tokens

Beat request tokens control how many custom beat requests you can submit each month:
