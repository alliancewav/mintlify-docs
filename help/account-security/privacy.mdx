## Promotional Email Tracking

BeatPass uses standard email analytics on promotional messages so we can understand whether our communications are helpful. These controls apply only to marketing and promotional emails—not transactional messages like receipts or security alerts.

### What Is Tracked

- **1x1 pixel**: Promotional emails include a tiny remote image that records when the email is opened. The pixel request logs your BeatPass account ID (if applicable), the timestamp, IP address, approximate location (derived from IP), and email client metadata provided by your mail app (e.g., user agent).
- **Tracked links**: Promotional links route through a BeatPass redirect that records the same details as above along with the destination URL and whether the click came from an email.

### How to Opt Out

- Go to **Settings > Notifications > Marketing Communications** and disable marketing and promotional emails.
- Alternatively, use the **unsubscribe** link included at the bottom of each promotional email.

### Reduce Tracking in Your Email Client

- **Disable remote image loading** to prevent the 1x1 pixel from loading. Most email apps provide a "Block external images" or "Protect from tracking" option.
- **Avoid clicking redirected links** or copy the visible URL into your browser to skip link tracking when possible.
- Use a **privacy-focused email client** that blocks tracking pixels and rewrites tracking links automatically.
