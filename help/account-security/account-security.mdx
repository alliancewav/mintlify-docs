## Password Security

### Strong Password Requirements

    Use at least 12 characters. Longer is better.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complexity">
    Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Uniqueness">
    Don't reuse passwords from other sites.
  </Step>

    Don't use personal info, dictionary words, or sequences like "123456".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Two-Factor Authentication

### What is 2FA?

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security beyond your password. Even if someone obtains your password, they can't access your account without the second factor.

### TOTP-Based Authentication

BeatPass uses **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** for two-factor authentication. This requires an authenticator app on your phone or computer.

<Note>
  SMS-based 2FA is not available. TOTP apps are more secure as they don't rely on phone carrier security.
</Note>

### Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings > Security**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable 2FA">
    Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scan QR Code">
    Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code displayed on screen.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Verification Code">
    Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app to confirm setup.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Recovery Codes">
    Download and securely store your recovery codes. These are your backup if you lose access to your authenticator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Save your recovery codes!** Store them in a secure location (password manager, safe, etc.). Without them, you may permanently lose access to your account if you lose your 2FA device.
</Warning>

### Recommended Authenticator Apps

| App | Platform | Features |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Google Authenticator | iOS, Android | Simple, reliable, free |
| Authy | iOS, Android, Desktop | Cloud backup, multi-device sync |
| 1Password | All platforms | Integrated with password manager |
| Microsoft Authenticator | iOS, Android | Free, works with Microsoft accounts |
| Bitwarden | All platforms | Open source, password manager integration |

### Using Recovery Codes

If you lose access to your authenticator app:

1. On the 2FA prompt, click **Use recovery code**
2. Enter one of your saved recovery codes
3. Each code can only be used once
4. After login, set up a new authenticator or generate new recovery codes

## Session Security

### Active Sessions

View and manage your active login sessions:

1. Go to **Settings > Security > Active Sessions**
2. Review all devices and locations
3. Revoke any sessions you don't recognize
