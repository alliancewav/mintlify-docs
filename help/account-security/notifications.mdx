  <Step title="Toggle Browser Channel">
    In your notification settings, ensure the **Browser** toggle is enabled for the notification types you want to receive instantly.

|--------|----------------|
| **Granted** | Browser toggles work normally |
| **Not Asked** | Clicking a browser toggle prompts for permission |
| **Blocked** | Warning banner shown, browser toggles are disabled |

<Tip>
  If you accidentally denied notification permissions, you can re-enable them in your browser settings under Site Permissions.
