## Upload Best Practices

### Audio Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="WAV" icon="file-audio" color="#22c55e">
    **Lossless** — Preferred format
  </Card>
  <Card title="FLAC" icon="file-audio" color="#22c55e">
    **Lossless Compressed** — Also accepted
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Lossless formats only.** BeatPass does not accept MP3 or other compressed formats. This ensures the highest quality for streaming and licensed downloads.
</Warning>

### Metadata Excellence

Complete metadata dramatically improves discovery:

- **Title**: Clear, memorable, searchable
- **BPM**: Accurate to help artists find matching beats
- **Key & Scale**: Helps artists match to their vocals
- **Genre**: Primary genre (most important filter)
- **Tags**: 5-10 relevant mood/style tags
- **Description**: Describe the vibe, inspiration, or use cases

### Pricing Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Streaming Only">
    Don't set a price. Earn from contribution-based revenue as users stream and engage.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Licensing">
    Set prices for different license tiers:
    - **Non-Exclusive**: Lower price, ongoing availability
    - **Exclusive**: Premium price, one-time sale
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Earnings

### Revenue Share Model

Producers earn from **subscription revenue splits** and **direct exclusive license sales**. BeatPass adds a platform fee on top of prices and does not deduct that fee from your listed license price. However, standard Stripe processing fees apply to payments.

| Revenue Source | Your Share (Conceptually) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Subscription pool** | Portion of each paid subscription invoice allocated to the producer pool and split using the contribution formula |
| **Exclusive license sales** | The price you set for the license, minus Stripe processing fees (the platform fee is charged on top to the buyer) |

Your share of the subscription pool is based on:

- **Plays** — How often your beats are streamed
- **Time decay** — Recent plays count more than old ones

### Where the Verified Badge Appears

- **Track pages** — On beats you've uploaded
- **Search results** — Verified producers are distinguished
- **Beat request responses** — Artists see you're verified

  If your artist name or profile changes significantly, you may need to re-verify through Discord to maintain your verified status.

| **After each license sale** | Earnings from exclusive purchases flow to your Stripe Connect account once the payment succeeds (minus fees) |
| **After each paid subscription invoice** | Contribution splits are calculated and Stripe Connect transfers are queued by the subscription split job |
| **Stripe to bank** | Stripe pays out to your bank on its normal payout schedule (typically 17 days depending on region) |
