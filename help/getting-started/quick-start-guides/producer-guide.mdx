Welcome to BeatPass as a producer! This guide covers everything you need to start uploading beats, tracking your success, and earning money from your music.

## Step 1: Access Your Producer Dashboard

Once you're approved as a producer, you'll see **Backstage** in your profile menu. Click it to access your Producer Dashboard.

The dashboard gives you a complete overview:

| Section | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Dashboard** | Performance overview and recent activity |
| **Finances** | Your earnings, payouts, and payment setup |
| **Activity** | Detailed analytics on your tracks |
| **Progress** | Your XP, level, and achievements |
| **Leaderboards** | Your rankings compared to other producers |
| **My Beats** | Manage your uploaded tracks |
| **My Collections** | Manage your beat packs |

## Step 2: Set Up Payments

Before you can receive earnings, you need to connect a payment account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Finances">
    In your Producer Dashboard, click **Finances** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Stripe">
    Click **Connect Stripe Account Now** to begin the setup process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Stripe onboarding">
    Follow Stripe's instructions to verify your identity and add your bank information. This takes about 5 minutes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for verification">
    Stripe typically verifies accounts within 1-2 business days. You'll receive an email when you're ready to receive payouts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  You can upload beats before connecting Stripe, but you won't receive payouts until your payment account is set up and verified.

## Step 3: Upload Your First Beat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Beats">
    In your Producer Dashboard, click **My Beats** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Upload or Create">
    Look for the upload button to start adding a new beat.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload your audio file">
    Upload your beat in a high-quality format (WAV recommended).

  <Step title="Add beat information">
    Fill in the details:
    - **Title** — Give your beat a memorable name
    - **Genre** — Choose the primary genre
    - **BPM** — Enter the tempo
    - **Key** — Specify the musical key
    - **Tags** — Add relevant tags to help people find your beat
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add artwork">
    Upload cover art for your beat. This is what people see when browsing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish">
    Review your beat information and publish when ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Complete metadata helps your beats get discovered. Take time to fill in genre, BPM, key, and tags accurately.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Understand How You Earn

### Subscription Revenue Sharing

When subscribers play your beats, you earn a share of the monthly subscription revenue. Your share depends on:

- **Play count** — How many times your beats are played
- **Contribution value** — A calculation based on play time and engagement
- **Your share** — Your percentage of the total revenue pool

### Exclusive Beat Sales

If you offer exclusive licenses, you earn from direct purchases. You receive 100% of the sale price — the 12% + \$3 platform fee is added on top rather than deducted from your earnings.

### Viewing Your Earnings

Go to **Finances** in your Producer Dashboard to see:

- Your total balance
- Recent transactions
- Payout history
- Estimated future earnings

## Step 5: Track Your Progress

BeatPass has a gamification system to reward active producers.

### XP and Levels

You earn XP (experience points) for activities like:

- Uploading new beats
- Getting plays on your tracks
- Completing your profile metadata
- Collaborating with other producers

As you earn XP, you level up from Novice to Legendary Producer.

### Achievements

Unlock achievements for milestones like:

- Uploading your first beat
- Reaching play count milestones
- Climbing the leaderboards
- Maintaining high-quality metadata

View your progress in the **Progress** section of your dashboard.

### Leaderboards

See how you rank against other producers in categories like:

- Overall performance
- Total plays
- Upload volume
- Quality score

Check the **Leaderboards** section to see your rankings.

## Tips for Success

### Upload Consistently

Regular uploads keep your profile active and give subscribers more content to discover. Aim for a consistent upload schedule.

### Optimize Your Metadata

Complete, accurate metadata helps your beats get discovered:

- Use descriptive titles
- Choose the right genres
- Add relevant tags
- Specify BPM and key accurately

### Engage with the Community

- Respond to comments on your beats
- Fulfill beat requests that match your style
- Collaborate with other producers

### Promote Your Profile

Share your BeatPass profile on social media and with your existing audience to drive traffic to your beats.
