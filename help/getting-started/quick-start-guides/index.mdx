## Not Sure Which Guide to Start With?

### I want to browse and listen

Start with the **Listener Quick Start**. You can explore BeatPass for free and upgrade later if you want to download beats.

### I want to download beats for my music

You'll need a subscription first. Start with the **Subscriber Quick Start** to learn how downloading and licensing works.

### I want to sell my beats

You'll need to be an approved producer. Check out the **Producer Quick Start** to learn about uploading and earning.

<Info>
  You can be multiple things at once! Many users are both subscribers (downloading beats from other producers) and producers (uploading their own beats).
