## Step 2: Download Your First Beat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a beat you like">
    Browse the catalog, search, or check out your liked beats.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click the download button">
    On the beat page or beat card, click the **download** icon.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your format">
    Select WAV (highest quality) or MP3 (smaller file size).

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Download in WAV format for the best quality when producing music. Use MP3 for quick previews or when file size matters.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Understand Your License

Every beat you download comes with a **non-exclusive license**. Here's what that means:

### What You Can Do

- Use the beat in your own songs and music releases
- Perform the beat live (up to 50 attendees)
- Use the beat in videos and content
- Keep and use the beat forever

### What's Required

- **Credit the producer** — Include "Produced by [Producer Name]" in your release credits
- **Don't claim ownership** — The beat remains the producer's intellectual property
- **No Content ID** — Don't register the beat with content ID services

### What's Not Included

- Exclusive rights (other artists can also license the same beat)
- Stem files (individual track layers)
- The right to resell or redistribute the beat

<Info>
  Want exclusive rights to a beat? Some producers offer exclusive purchases. Look for the exclusive option on beat pages where available.

## Step 4: Access Your License Certificates

Every download generates a license certificate. To find your certificates:

1. Click **My Licenses** in the sidebar under Your Library
2. Find the beat you downloaded
3. Click to view or download your license certificate

Keep your license certificates as proof that you have the right to use the beats.

## Step 5: Manage Your Subscription
