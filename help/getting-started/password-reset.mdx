## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I didn't receive the reset email">
    - Check your spam or junk folder
    - Make sure you entered the correct email address
    - Wait a few minutes — emails can sometimes be delayed
    - Try requesting a new reset link
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The reset link isn't working">
    Password reset links expire for security reasons. If your link has expired or isn't working:
    1. Return to the forgot password page
    2. Request a new reset link
    3. Use the new link immediately
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't remember which email I used">
    Try any email addresses you commonly use. If you still can't find your account, contact our support team at contact@beatpass.ca for assistance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I keep getting 'invalid token' errors">
    This usually means the reset link has expired or has already been used. Request a fresh reset link and use it right away.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Note

<Warning>
  Never share your password reset links with anyone. BeatPass staff will never ask for your password or reset links.
</Warning>

If you didn't request a password reset and received an email about it, someone may have entered your email by mistake. You can safely ignore the email — your password won't change unless you click the link and complete the reset process.
