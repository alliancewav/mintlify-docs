BeatPass offers different ways to use the platform depending on your needs. Here's what each option provides.

## Free Users (Explorer)

When you create an account, you start with free Explorer access. This lets you:

- **Stream** all beats in the catalog
- **Create playlists** to organize your favorites
- **Like and save** beats for later
- **Follow producers** to stay updated on new uploads
- **Comment** on beats
- **Submit beat requests** to find specific sounds
- **View your listening history**

<Info>
  Explorer users can discover and enjoy all the music on BeatPass, but downloading beats requires a paid subscription.

## Subscribers

Subscribers pay a monthly fee to unlock downloads and commercial licensing. In addition to all Explorer features, subscribers can:

- **Download beats** with commercial licenses

Producers are users who upload beats to BeatPass. Being a producer gives you:

- **Upload beats** to the platform
- **Earn money** from plays and downloads
- **Producer Dashboard** with analytics and earnings tracking
- **Progress system** with XP, levels, and achievements
- **Leaderboard rankings** to showcase your success
- **Verified badge** opportunity for established producers

### How to Become a Producer

To upload beats on BeatPass, you need to apply for a producer account:

1. Go to your profile menu and look for the producer application option
2. Submit your application with information about yourself and your music
3. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 business days)
4. Once approved, you'll see **Backstage** in your profile menu

<Info>
  Producer approval helps maintain quality on the platform. Make sure your application showcases your best work.
