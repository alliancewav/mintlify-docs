## Summary

A critical fix for engagement metrics ensuring that partial listens, skips, and background plays are accurately recorded. This update increases data capture from ~10% to over 90% of all playback activity.

## What's New

- **Partial Listen Tracking**: The system now captures duration data for all listens over 10 seconds, even if the track isn't finished.
- **Reliable Data Delivery**: Implemented `navigator.sendBeacon` to guarantee data is sent even when a user closes the tab or navigates away.
- **Guest Tracking**: Anonymous plays are now properly recorded and visible in "Top Listeners" as aggregated guest traffic.
- **Entity Scoping**: Fixed a bug where track and album analytics were showing global artist data. Now, insights are strictly scoped to the specific entity.

## Why It Matters

- **Accurate Reporting**: Producers now see the true engagement on their tracks, not just full completions.
- **Better Insights**: Understanding drop-off points (via completion rate) helps artists improve their content.
- **Data Integrity**: Eliminates the "Not Available" state for engagement metrics on most tracks.

## Technical Details

- **Event Triggers**: Duration is now sent on `pause`, `seek`, `track_change`, and `page_unload`.
- **Threshold**: A 10-second minimum threshold filters out accidental clicks.
- **Backend**: `TrackPlaysController` now accepts and aggregates partial duration updates.
