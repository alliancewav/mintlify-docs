We've fixed several issues affecting artist profiles and improved the experience when uploading tracks.

## Artist Profile Fixes

### Verified Badge Now Stays Put

**Issue:** Some verified artists were losing their verified checkmark after updating their profile (like adding gallery images).

**Now:** Your verified status is preserved no matter what changes you make to your profile. Update your bio, upload gallery images, or edit any other details—your verification stays intact.

### Unclaimed Profile Badge Fixed

**Issue:** The "Unclaimed" badge wasn't appearing correctly on some artist profiles, making it confusing to know which profiles could be claimed.

**Now:** The unclaimed badge correctly appears on any artist profile that hasn't been linked to a user account yet. If you see an unclaimed profile that belongs to you, you can claim it to take ownership.

### Profile Ownership Detection

**Issue:** Some artist profiles weren't correctly recognizing their owner, which affected features like the claim banner and profile management.

**Now:** Artist ownership is properly detected, so you'll see the right options when viewing your own profile versus someone else's.

## Upload Improvements

### WAV Format Requirement

Track uploads now require WAV format. Here's why this matters:

- **Best sound quality** — Your beats sound exactly as you intended
- **Industry standard** — The format professionals use for licensing
- **No compression artifacts** — What you upload is what listeners hear

### Helpful Format Modal

When you try to upload a file in an unsupported format, you'll now see a clear, helpful message instead of a confusing error:

- Shows exactly which file was blocked and why
- Explains the benefits of WAV format
- Makes it easy to upload a different file with one click

This gives you clear guidance instead of leaving you wondering what went wrong.

## What This Means for You

- **Verified artists** — Your status is safe when editing your profile
- **Profile claimers** — Unclaimed profiles are now clearly marked
- **Uploaders** — Clear guidance when file formats need adjustment
