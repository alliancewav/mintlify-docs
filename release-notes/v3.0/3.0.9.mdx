# Beat Request Overhaul

## Summary

A comprehensive audit and upgrade of the Beat Request system — fixing critical token accounting bugs, adding new producer submission safeguards, and redesigning the feed and submission experience for both requesters and producers.

---

## What's New

### Feed Redesign

- **"All" and "My Requests" tabs** — Switch between the public feed and your own requests in one click
- **Genre filter** — Narrow the feed to requests matching your style
- **Sort options** — Sort by newest, expiring soon, most submissions, or budget
- **Expired requests hidden** — The "All" tab now shows only active requests, reducing clutter
- **Relative timestamps** — See when a request was posted (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago") alongside the expiry countdown

### Submission Improvements (Producers)

- **Multi-track selection** — Select and submit multiple tracks at once instead of one at a time
- **5-track submission limit** — Each producer can submit up to 5 tracks per request
- **Already-submitted marking** — Tracks you've already sent are visually flagged so you won't pick duplicates
- **Duplicate audio detection** — Tracks matching an existing submission's audio fingerprint are automatically blocked
- **Platform-hosted requirement** — Only tracks uploaded to BeatPass (not external links) can be submitted
- **Fingerprint verification** — Tracks must have a completed audio fingerprint before submission
- **Upload via Backstage** — The "Upload New Track" option now opens your Backstage in a new tab for a smoother upload workflow

### Request Creation

- **Budget currency selector** — Choose from USD, EUR, GBP, or CAD when setting a budget
- **Genre stored as display name** — Genre labels now appear exactly as shown in the platform

### Token System Fixes

- **Multi-token refunds** — Deleting a 48h or 72h request now correctly refunds 2 or 3 tokens (previously always refunded 1)
- **Accurate usage tracking** — Token usage now sums actual token amounts instead of counting transaction rows, preventing over-limit submissions
- **Plan upgrade token refresh** — Upgrading your plan now correctly resets your token balance to the new plan's limit immediately
- **Rollback safety** — If request creation fails partway through, the full token cost is returned (not just 1 token)

### Renewal Fix

- **Original duration preserved** — Renewing an expired request now reactivates it for its original duration (24, 48, or 72 hours) instead of always defaulting to 24 hours

### Routing & Stability

- **Route resolution fixed** — Statistics and duration-tier endpoints no longer incorrectly match as request IDs
- **New submissions endpoint** — Request owners can now view submitted tracks directly (track name, producer name, timestamp)
- **Duration-aware copy** — All UI text now reflects the correct duration tier instead of hardcoded "24 hours"

---

## Why It Matters

- **Producers** get a faster, smarter submission flow with safeguards against duplicates and clearer feedback
- **Requesters** can browse and manage requests more efficiently with filters, tabs, and accurate token tracking
- **Everyone** benefits from correct multi-token accounting — no more lost tokens when deleting or failing to create higher-tier requests

## How to Use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Beat Requests">
    Navigate to **Beat Requests** from the main menu. Use the **All** and **My Requests** tabs to switch views. Filter by genre and sort by your preferred criteria.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Request">
    Click **Create Request**, fill in your description and reference track, optionally set a budget with currency, and choose a duration tier (24h, 48h, or 72h).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Beats (Producers)">
    Click **Send Beat** on any active request. Select one or more tracks from your catalog (up to 5). Already-submitted tracks are marked. Click **Send** to submit.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Your Requests">
    Switch to the **My Requests** tab to see all your active and expired requests. Delete to reclaim tokens or renew expired requests within 30 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>
