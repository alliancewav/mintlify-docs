We've made significant improvements to how BeatPass looks and feels. The platform now adapts its colors based on what you're viewing, shows trending indicators on popular tracks, and loads content faster than ever.

## Dynamic Color Themes

The player and page backgrounds now adapt their colors based on the album artwork or artist image you're viewing. This creates a more immersive experience that matches the mood of each track.

### How It Works

- **While playing music** — The interface subtly shifts to complement the currently playing track's cover art
- **On artist pages** — Colors adapt to match the artist's profile image
- **On album pages** — The theme reflects the album cover colors
- **On track pages** — Colors match the track's artwork

The color shifts are smooth and instant once you've visited a page—previous colors are remembered so there's no waiting when you return.

### Grayscale Images

For black and white artwork or profile images, the interface now shows neutral gray tones instead of picking up random colors. This ensures a clean, consistent look for monochrome content.

## Trending Indicators

Tracks that are gaining popularity now show a trending icon next to their name. This makes it easy to discover what's hot on the platform.

### Where You'll See Them

- **Track listings** — On artist pages, album pages, and playlists
- **Track pages** — Next to the track title
- **Search results** — Quickly spot trending tracks
- **Discover page** — In all track carousels and grids

The trending indicator shows a percentage that represents recent growth in plays and engagement.

## Faster Loading

We've made major improvements to how quickly content loads, especially on pages with lots of tracks.

### What's Improved

- **Waveform visualizations** — Now load in batches instead of one at a time, significantly reducing loading time on pages with many tracks
- **Auto-scrolling carousels** — Pre-load all content upfront so there's no delay as slides change
- **Track lists** — Load growth data and license information more efficiently
- **Repeat visits** — Previously loaded waveforms are remembered for instant display

### Performance on Large Catalogs

Artists with hundreds of tracks will notice much faster loading on their discography pages. The system now handles large catalogs gracefully without overwhelming your browser or using excessive data.

## What This Means for You

- **More immersive browsing** — The visual experience adapts to what you're listening to and viewing
- **Easier discovery** — Trending indicators help you find popular tracks quickly
- **Faster navigation** — Pages load quicker, especially those with many tracks
- **Smoother playback** — Less loading means fewer interruptions to your listening experience
- **Better on mobile** — Optimizations benefit mobile devices with slower connections

## Timeline
