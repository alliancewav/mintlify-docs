We've resolved issues that were preventing some track uploads from completing successfully. New beats now appear on the Discover page immediately after publishing—no need to refresh or wait.

## What We Fixed

### Track Upload Errors

Some producers were experiencing errors when trying to upload new tracks. The upload would start normally, but an error would appear during the final publishing step.

**What was happening:** The system was looking for audio visualization data before it had been created, causing the upload to fail.

**Now:** Uploads complete smoothly, and the waveform visualization appears once processing finishes.

### Publishing Errors

After uploading a track, some producers saw an error when trying to publish. This was preventing tracks from going live.

**What was happening:** The notification system that alerts your followers about new uploads wasn't handling certain data correctly.

**Now:** Tracks publish successfully, and your followers receive notifications as expected.

### Instant Visibility on Discover Page

Previously, after uploading a new track, it might not appear on the Discover page right away. Some producers had to manually clear their browser cache or wait for the system to refresh.

**What was happening:** The website was holding onto old data instead of checking for new content.

**Now:** Your new tracks appear on the Discover page immediately after publishing. No waiting, no refreshing needed.

## What This Means for You

- **Smoother uploads** — No more unexpected errors during the upload process
- **Instant publishing** — Your beats go live the moment you hit publish
- **Immediate visibility** — New tracks appear on the Discover page right away
- **Follower notifications work** — Your fans get notified when you drop new heat

## Timeline

**December 17, 2025** — All fixes deployed and live
