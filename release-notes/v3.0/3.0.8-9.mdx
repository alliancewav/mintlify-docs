## Summary

A comprehensive set of updates focused on system reliability, data integrity, and operational monitoring across Gamification, Subscription Splits, and Financial Reporting.

## What's New

### Gamification & XP
- **100% Achievement Coverage**: All 39 achievements are now fully mapped and tracking correctly.
- **Zero-XP Badges**: Clear "No XP" indicators for seasonal or milestone badges that don't award points.
- **Manual Refresh**: Added a refresh button to the Producer Progress page for real-time updates.
- **Collaborator Rules**: Clarified that collaborators must have completed profiles to earn XP from plays.

### Subscription Splits & Billing
- **Accurate Split Calculation**: Fixed critical bugs in how artist contributions are calculated for subscription revenue.
- **Metadata Reliability**: Enhanced detection of subscription metadata to ensure no revenue is missed.
- **Stripe Connect Transfers**: Automated transfers now include robust retry logic for failed payouts.

### Financial Reporting
- **Pagination Fixes**: Resolved an issue where high-volume transaction history was truncated silently. Now fetches up to 1,000 records consistently.
- **Multi-Currency Transparency**: Clearer breakdown of balances by currency, with warnings about non-converted totals.
- **Cache Accuracy**: "Last Updated" timestamps now accurately reflect the data age.

## Why It Matters

These updates are "under the hood" but critical for trust and reliability.
- **For Artists**: You can trust that your XP, achievements, and revenue splits are calculated accurately.
- **For Everyone**: The platform is more stable, with better error handling and data visibility.

## Known Issues

- **Transaction History Limit**: Financial history is currently capped at the most recent 1,000 records per source. We are working on pagination for full history access.
- **Multi-Currency Totals**: Aggregate totals show the primary currency only. Please refer to the per-currency breakdown for exact figures.
