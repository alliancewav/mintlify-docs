# Platform Fee Update

We've updated our platform fee structure to better serve our community of producers and buyers.

---

## What's Changed

### New Fee Structure

| Component | Old Fee | New Fee |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Percentage** | 15% | 12% |
| **Flat Fee** | None | +\$3 |

**Formula**: (Beat Price × 0.12) + \$3 = Total Platform Fee

### Examples

| Beat Price | Old Total | New Total | Difference |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| \$50 | \$57.50 | \$59.00 | +\$1.50 |
| \$100 | \$115.00 | \$115.00 | No change |
| \$200 | \$230.00 | \$227.00 | -\$3.00 |

## What This Means for You

### For Buyers

- Lower-priced beats (\$50 and under): Slightly higher total cost
- Mid-range beats (\$100): No change in total cost
- Higher-priced beats (\$150+): Lower total cost

### For Producers

- **Your earnings remain unchanged** — You still receive 100% of your listed price
- The platform fee is paid by buyers on top of your price
- No action required on your part

## Why We Made This Change

This fee structure:

- **Reduces costs** for higher-priced exclusive beat sales
- **Maintains platform sustainability** with a modest flat fee component
- **Keeps pricing transparent** and predictable for all users
- **Better aligns** with typical beat pricing in the industry
