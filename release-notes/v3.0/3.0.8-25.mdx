# API Security Hardening

<Card title="Security Update" icon="shield" color="#22c55e">
  <Badge color="green" size="lg">SECURITY</Badge>
  Comprehensive API security audit and hardening
</Card>

We've completed a comprehensive security audit of the BeatPass API, strengthening authentication, rate limiting, and data protection across the platform.

<Note>
  No action is required from users. All improvements have been automatically applied. Existing developer tokens continue to work normally.
</Note>

## What's Improved

### Authentication Hardening

Sensitive API endpoints now enforce authentication at the routing level, providing defense-in-depth security:

- **Track downloads and licensing** — Download, license certificate, and license generation endpoints now require authentication
- **Audio fingerprinting** — Fingerprint generation, status checks, and duplicate detection endpoints are now protected
- **Video uploads** — Video chunk upload and processing endpoints require authentication
- **Producer earnings** — Contribution pool and earnings data endpoints are now secured
- **Content management** — Genre creation/editing and coupon management require authentication

### Developer Token Support

The API now fully supports **personal access tokens** for developer integrations:

- Generate tokens from the **Developers** panel in **Account Settings**
- Tokens use `Bearer` authentication in the `Authorization` header
- Tokens expire after **90 days** for security
- The `api.access` permission is enforced for external API requests

### Rate Limiting

New rate limits protect against abuse while maintaining smooth normal usage:

| Endpoint | Limit | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Global API** | 300/min | Platform-wide baseline |
| **Audio proxy** | 30/min | Audio file serving |
| **Image proxy** | 60/min | Image file serving |
| **Track plays** | 30/min | Play count logging |
| **Video uploads** | 60/min | Chunked video uploads |
| **Play duration** | 60/min | Listen duration tracking |

<Info>
  These limits are generous for normal usage. A typical listening session uses fewer than 5 requests per minute.
</Info>

### Data Protection

API responses now follow the principle of least privilege for data exposure:

- **Audio fingerprint data** — Proprietary fingerprint data and direct audio URLs are no longer exposed in API responses
- **Internal system fields** — Internal-only fields (waveform metadata, system timestamps) are hidden from API responses
- **Sensitive user data** — Contact emails, buyer information, and moderation fields are protected from external API access while remaining available to the platform interface

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is now configured with explicit domain whitelisting instead of wildcard access, with a 24-hour preflight cache for improved performance.

## For Developers

If you use the BeatPass API with developer tokens:

- **No breaking changes** — All existing public endpoints continue to work
- **Token expiration** — Tokens now expire after 90 days. Generate a new token from Account Settings when needed
- **Rate limit headers** — Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers to stay within limits
- **Updated documentation** — See [Authentication](/developers/auth) and [Rate Limits](/developers/rate-limits) for full details

## Your Data & Security

| Data Type | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Passwords** | No impact — encrypted and secure |
| **Payment info** | No impact — handled by Stripe |
| **Personal data** | Enhanced protection — sensitive fields restricted |
| **Uploaded content** | Enhanced protection — fingerprint data secured |
