# Audio Recon

## Summary

BeatPass now automatically detects songs on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer that sound similar to your beats. Powered by <Tooltip tip="BeatPass's audio fingerprinting technology that creates a unique digital signature of your beat's audio waveform.">BeatPassID</Tooltip> fingerprinting, Audio Recon scans streaming catalogs monthly and notifies you with full song details, streaming links, and a similarity score — so you can investigate potential placements of your work.

<Info>
  Audio Recon detects audio **similarity**, not confirmed placements. A match could indicate your beat was used, or it could be a shared sample or coincidence. Always verify by listening.
</Info>

## What's New

- **Automatic audio scanning** — Your uploaded beats are compared against millions of songs on Spotify, YouTube, and Deezer each month
- **Audio Recon section** — A new producer-only section on your track page shows all detected similarities with song title, artist, similarity score, and streaming links
- **Similarity notifications** — Receive in-app and email notifications when a new match is detected, with direct links to listen and verify
- **Honest match guidance** — Each notification clearly explains that matches indicate audio similarity, not confirmed placements, and provides steps to verify
- **Collaborative beat support** — For beats with multiple credited producers, only one needs a verified profile for the beat to be scanned. All credited producers with accounts are notified
- **Notification preferences** — Control Audio Recon notifications from your [notification preferences](https://open.beatpass.ca/notifications/settings) under the **Audio Recon** group

---

## Why It Matters

- **Stay informed** — Know when songs on streaming platforms share audio characteristics with your beats
- **Verify potential placements** — Cross-reference matches with your download notifications and license certificates to confirm whether your beat was actually used
- **Take action when needed** — If you confirm unauthorized use of your beat, BeatPass support can help you with next steps
- **Zero effort** — Scans run automatically each month. No setup, no manual checking

## How to Use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get verified">
    If you don't have a verified producer profile yet, [request verification](https://open.beatpass.ca/backstage/requests/verify-artist) from your Backstage area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload beats">
    Upload your beats through Backstage. BeatPassID automatically fingerprints each track on upload.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for the next scan">
    Scans run monthly. When a match is found, you'll see it in the **Audio Recon** section on your track page and receive a notification.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the match">
    Listen to the matched song using the streaming links. Determine whether it actually uses your beat or just sounds similar. If it's a genuine use, check your download notifications to confirm licensing status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bug Fixes

### Audio Recon Section Not Appearing

Fixed a bug where the **Audio Recon** section on track pages was not visible to producers who manage the track through their linked artist profile. The section now correctly appears for:

1. **Track uploaders** — Producers who uploaded the beat directly
2. **Linked producers** — Producers whose artist profile is credited on the track (including collaborators)
3. **Admins** — Platform administrators

The section also now matches the visual style of the rest of the track page.

### Stripe Connect Onboarding Popup

Fixed a bug where the **Connect Your Payment Account** popup was appearing for regular users who do not have a producer (artist) profile. The popup now only triggers for users who:

1. **Have a linked artist profile** on BeatPass
2. **Have not yet completed** Stripe Connect onboarding (account not connected, or charges/payouts not enabled)

Previously, the popup would appear for every logged-in user, even those without a producer profile. This is now fully resolved.

<Info>If you are a regular listener or subscriber without a producer profile, you will never see this popup. Producers who have already connected their Stripe account will also not see it.</Info>

### Artist Credits Ordering & Display

Fixed the **Credits** section on artist profiles to correctly show the most recent credits first. Previously, artists with more than 24 credits had their **newest** credits hidden instead of their oldest.

**What changed:**
- Your public profile now displays credits sorted by release date, newest first
- The **Backstage** editor still uses your manual drag-and-drop ordering
- Credits now show **eight items by default** on desktop (two rows of four) with a **Show More** button for progressive loading
- **Show More** first reveals already-loaded credits before fetching more — efficient for profiles with 100+ credits
- Visible count resets to eight when switching between role filters
- Role filter pills now use the platform's standard chip style for visual consistency

### Producer Program Banner

Corrected the **Ready to Share Your Beats?** banner displayed on track pages for non-producers. The banner previously claimed "Earn 85% revenue share" which was outdated. It now correctly reads "100% net revenue share" to match the [Producer Program](https://open.beatpass.ca/producer-program) page — producers receive 100% of their listed price, with the platform fee added on top for the buyer.

## Improvements

### Pinned Track Banner

Redesigned the **Pinned Track** banner on artist profiles for a cleaner, more compact look:

- Cover art now displays as a **circular thumbnail** with a play/pause overlay on hover
- Track name, artist, duration, and play count are displayed in a **compact two-row layout**
- The **Unpin** button appears only on hover for a cleaner default appearance
- The banner uses a subtle card style with rounded corners for better visual integration with the rest of the profile

### Mobile Lyrics View

Improved the lyrics experience on mobile:

- **White-themed seekbar** and playback controls for better visibility in fullscreen mode
- **Synced lyrics auto-scroll** with animated line highlighting that follows playback
- **Lyrics auto-save** — Editing lyrics now uses debounced saving with automatic retry and rate limit handling, so you never lose your edits

### Mobile Player

Enhanced the fullscreen mobile player:

- **About the Producer** — A new section in the fullscreen player shows producer details, bio, follower count, and social links
- **Colored gradient background** based on the current track's cover art for a more immersive experience
- **Drag-to-close** gesture for natural interaction
- Improved visual consistency with the rest of the platform

### Stripe Connect Onboarding

Enhanced the payment account connection flow:

- The **Connect Stripe Account** button now shows a loading spinner while the connection is in progress
- Redirect URLs are validated before navigation to prevent errors
- Clearer error messages when the connection attempt fails

### Platform Reliability

Improved data-fetching type safety across the platform, reducing potential errors in how the app loads and displays your data. This is a behind-the-scenes improvement that makes BeatPass more reliable.
