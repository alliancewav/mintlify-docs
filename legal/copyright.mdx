## Overview

BeatPass respects intellectual property rights and expects all users to do the same. This page explains copyright basics, our policies, and how to handle infringement.

## Copyright Basics

### What Copyright Protects

When you create an original beat, you automatically own the copyright. This gives you exclusive rights to:

- Reproduce the work
- Distribute copies
- Create derivative works
- Publicly perform the work
- License others to use the work

### What You Can Upload

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Your Original Work">
    Beats you created from scratch. You own full rights.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Properly Licensed Samples">
    Samples from royalty-free libraries where you have a valid license for commercial use.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cleared Samples">
    Samples you've obtained explicit permission to use from the rights holder.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Collaborative Works">
    Works where you have permission from all contributors to upload and license.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What You Cannot Upload

<Warning>
  Uploading content you don't have rights to violates our Terms of Service and may result in account termination.
</Warning>

- Beats containing uncleared samples from commercial songs
- Content created by someone else without permission
- Works where collaborators haven't agreed to the upload
- Content that infringes trademarks or other IP rights

## Audio Fingerprinting

### How It Works

Every track uploaded to BeatPass receives a unique audio fingerprint:

1. **On Upload**: Audio is analyzed to generate a fingerprint
2. **Duplicate Check**: Fingerprint compared against existing database
3. **Match Detection**: Potential duplicates are flagged for review

### What Fingerprinting Catches

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Exact duplicate | Upload blocked |
| Slightly modified duplicate | Flagged for manual review |
| Using your own older track | Notified, allowed with confirmation |
| Similar but original | Usually passes |
