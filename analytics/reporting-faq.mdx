## Data & Accuracy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often is my data updated?">
    - **Plays/Completions**: Near real-time (within minutes)
    - **Contribution Value**: Every 6 hours
    - **Rankings**: Every 30 minutes
    - **Monthly totals**: Finalized at month end
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why do my play counts seem low?">
    Possible reasons:
    - Only valid plays are counted (fraud detection removes artificial plays)
    - Very short plays (under a few seconds) may not register
    - There may be a slight delay in data processing
    - Check the date range selected in your dashboard
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my completion rate drop?">
    Completion rate can drop if:
    - New listeners are sampling but not finishing tracks
    - Your track was added to a playlist where listeners skip
    - You gained discovery traffic that's less engaged
    
    Focus on the trend over time rather than daily fluctuations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are bot plays counted?">
    No. BeatPass uses fraud detection to filter artificial plays. Only genuine engagement counts toward your metrics and contribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Contribution & Earnings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does my estimated earnings fluctuate?">
    Estimated earnings are projections based on:
    - Your current contribution value
    - Total platform engagement (which changes constantly)
    - Pool size estimates
    
    Final amounts are calculated at month end.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is my contribution value different from plays?">
    Contribution value isn't just play count. It factors in:
    - Completion rate (higher = better)
    - Save rate
    - Audience quality signals
    - Your performance relative to all producers
    
    See the [Contribution Formula](/contribution/formula) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When are earnings finalized?">
    Monthly earnings are calculated after the calendar month ends, typically in the first week of the following month. Payouts process shortly after.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I see earnings per track?">
    Yes. Each track shows its contribution value in the Backstage Insights. This represents that track's share of your total contribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dashboard Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I export my analytics data?">
    Currently, data export is limited. You can view all data in the dashboard and take screenshots for your records. Enhanced export features are planned.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I compare different time periods?">
    Yes. Use the date range selector to view different periods. The dashboard shows trend indicators comparing current period to previous.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see geographic data?">
    Geographic data requires sufficient play volume. If your tracks are new or have low plays, location data may not be available yet.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does 'N/A' mean in my dashboard?">
    N/A appears when:
    - Insufficient data for calculation
    - Feature not yet available for your account
    - Data is still processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Trends

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's a 'good' completion rate?">
    Benchmarks vary by genre, but generally:
    - **Excellent**: 70%+
    - **Good**: 50-70%
    - **Average**: 30-50%
    - **Low**: Below 30%
    
    Focus on improving over time rather than hitting a specific number.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know if I'm growing?">
    Look for:
    - Rising play counts over 30-90 day periods
    - Increasing follower count
    - Higher contribution value month-over-month
    - More saves per upload
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my ranking drop even though plays increased?">
    Rankings are relative. If other producers grew faster, your rank may drop even with personal growth. Focus on your own metrics rather than ranking alone.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the best day/time to upload?">
    This varies by audience. Use your analytics to identify when your listeners are most active, then schedule uploads accordingly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
